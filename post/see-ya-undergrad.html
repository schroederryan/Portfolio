			<h1>See Ya Undergrad</h1>
			<span>May 1st, 2017</span>
			<p>I have to start this out by saying I honestly can’t believe I am already writing this. 4 years and 120 credit hours went by way too fast and I’m a little sad to see it go. Michigan State was my dream college and the only place I really saw myself attending. I toured a couple others, mainly to please my parents because these were places that were giving me scholarships but I always knew I would be a Spartan. </p>
			<p>These past 4 years have given me everything I could have imagined and more. I live with friends I made the very first weekend at school and one I met in the parking lot in July before even starting our academic orientation. I still regularly talk to a friend I met in my very first college course, another I met through Twitter and at a frat party and we regularly go out with people I met on our floor my second year in the dorms. I’m constantly reminded by colleagues and family how incredibly lucky I am to have such a close friend group and while I definitely knew that, it’s become more and more apparent as I write this out. These people know who they are and I’m forever grateful for the lifelong friendships I know we’ll have.</p>
			<p>In 4 years I have volunteered, had 3 different jobs, presented at a couple different conferences and, in true college form, went out way too many times (only after I turned 21 of course). I’ve watched some of the greatest football games in MSU history: 100th Annual Rose Bowl, the comeback at the Cotton Bowl against Baylor and of course the return of the botched punt to beat UM as the clock ran out. I’ve witness our basketball team play as the number 1 team in the country and make it to the final four of the NCAA tournament.</p>
			<p>In the classroom - one of the main reasons I was here I suppose - I learned a ton on technology and how to optimize that for different users. I’ve also been on the Dean’s list, achieving a 3.5 or higher, each of the 8 semesters I completed. All of this and I still was just .01 points away from graduating with honors, go figure. </p>
			<p>East Lansing has been my home for the last 4 years and it’ll be weird not coming back for welcome week in the fall. Though this chapter of my life is ending, the next is just beginning and my college days are far from over.</p>
			<p>As for what’s next, many already know I accepted a position at Quicken Loans in Detroit working on an internal program for our bankers. I have been working with them for the past 1 now and am very excited to get started full time. I will also be applying for and then starting my Masters of Business Administration (MBA) at Wayne State a few months after I get settled in Detroit. I started thinking about how much free time I was going to have only working 40 hours a week and I decided to go for my masters right away.</p>
			<p>I cannot thank MSU enough for giving me more than I could have ever imagined. My time here has given me an incredible 4 years and a future I am extremely excited for.</p>
