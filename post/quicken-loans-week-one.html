			<h1>Quicken Loans: Week 1</h1>
			<span>May 13th, 2016</span>
			<p>Well, my first week is officially in the books and I think I learned more things in the first week here than I have in my first three years of college. I’m obviously kidding but I have learned an incredible amount since starting on Monday. However, I have LOVED every second of it so far. Quicken Loans is a great company to work/intern for and that was apparent on my very first day.</p>
			<p>Unlike most positions that just throw you in the mix of things on the first day, our first day was a day-long orientation aimed at helping us get familiar with the company. We spent the day learning about the over 90 companies within the “Quicken Loans Family of Companies” while also learning about everything going on in the city of Detroit. This is where I learned that I am just one of about 1,200 interns this summer. But, if that sounds like a big number, I also learned that we were the ones lucky enough to get the position out of over 12,000 applicants. 12,000 people want an internship with this company — that’s how great it is and it didn’t get it’s #4 nationally ranked internship program by not being great.  Even though they have so many interns, they treat everyone like a family and we were notified of all the benefits we get as a “team member” of this company. Also, at one point in the day, they made us audibly say, “Lebron James is my team member” which is technically true as he plays for the Cleveland Cavaliers and the owner of the Cavs just so happens to be the same guy that founded Quicken Loans, Dan Gilbert. Pretty cool!</p>
			<p>My first official day was Tuesday and this is where the lingo started. AE, QFR, HUD, GUMP, DIGG, GUS and AMP. Know what any of those means? Neither did I but that’s not even the full list of acronyms that are used throughout the day in conversation that I had to start learning. It’s like a secret language here and you just have to start picking up on it. I sat in on several meetings that talked a lot about the different guidelines to getting a loan and what continuity of obligation is and all of these different steps to the loan process and my brain was moving faster than I think it ever had before. Luckily, my parents were in the real estate business for quite a few years and I was able to piece together a lot of information from that. Things like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac I could think back to all the times my parents referenced them and figure out what was being said so thanks mom and dad!</p>
			<p>Throughout the second day I was able to get a feel for the culture of the company and let me tell you, it’s great. It’s a very relaxed company that loves its emails and meetings. Meetings are often booked in wherever there is a room and that can be on any floor (mind you these are skyscrapers we’re working in) in any of the buildings which is about 5 or 6. This means walking outside to the different buildings which can be a great way to get out and get some air which I found refreshing. Granted, I am not working during the winter time when it would be very inconvenient. In my first day, this was especially cool though because I got to see more of Detroit and more of the departments within the company. </p>
			<p>My third day on the job was the day I finally got my own desk. They were still shifting things around which caused the delay but I was finally hooked up with a desk, 2 monitors in addition to the 3rd monitor of my company-provided laptop and a phone that I got to set up with my own personal greeting. I sat in on a few other meetings to discuss different guidelines and verbiage of the guidelines on the program. I also got treated to a lunch at the Detroit Beer Company as part of the “New Team Member Lunch” which was a great experience. I went out with the whole team and had the chance to really get to know everyone better.</p>
			<p>In addition to the fun things on my third day, I had the opportunity to really learn more about the program that I am going to be working with all summer. The program is called GURU and it’s basically a Google for Quicken Loans. Team members (our term for employees) can access How-To guidelines and different documents through a search on GURU. This helps them make sure they are processing and executing loans properly and gives them a place to look up any questions they may have. My job is to make this more user-friendly. They want everyone in the company to use this and I need to make sure it’s the best it possibly can be. With that said, I was able to sit down with the program and take a lot of notes on things I wanted to bring up in a future meeting which was a great experience. Being able to voice my opinion so early on is very valuable to me and there is a lot of things I have opinions on!</p>
			<p>Thursday brought my first success as an intern. We were fixing a little gadget in GURU and the person who developed the gadget wasn’t sure why it wasn’t working. I had to go in and figure out what was wrong and after a little bit, I was able to find the error and fix it. We also had a department wide lunch which provided me another opportunity to meet and talk to the people I will be working with all summer. I had been provided lunch 3 out of the 4 days at this point and I’m really hoping that this is a trend that continues throughout the summer. Thursday was a little more normal and it was actual the first day where I didn’t leave my floor the entire day. I was on the 8th floor in my department the entire day (lunch was on this floor too) and it felt really strange.</p>
			<p>Friday was more of the same. Though, Friday’s are jeans days but nobody told me that and literally everyone else was in jeans except me. So that was a fun aspect of the day. However, I did get to spend even more time with the products that I will be working with and did some preliminary research on a new product that we will be building soon. I was also able to give a lot of my feedback on the program as a whole as I saw it. I had the opportunity to sit down with everyone on the team and tell them what I thought of it and they were all very receptive to the input I had. A lot of the items I brought up had been mentioned before but were never changed because they weren’t really sure how. Overall, everyone was really nice about the feedback and it made me feel very comfortable when telling them how their product could be improved on.</p>
			<p>In addition to everything related to my actual internship, my housing has been great and everything has been safe and secure in the city that everyone seems to have a problem with. Detroit is very vibrant throughout the day and there is a lot going on. Additionally, I have to scan into my building every time I enter and leave and have not once felt unsafe. My commute to work is through Quicken Loans, too and they pick me and the rest of the interns up right at Wayne State and drop us off right downtown and from there it’s a 5 minute walk to my building. They talked a lot about the security within Detroit and all that is going on and I gotta say I am loving working in the city and getting to experience a big city especially one that has so much going on. I work right off of the road where the new street car is being built and in every direction there is construction. Also, every day there are countless food trucks that come into the city to serve people in a local park outside my building and there will be live music every day downtown for us to enjoy our lunch to. I very much look forward to getting to explore the city a lot more and getting to experience everything that Detroit has to offer.</p>
			<p>So, to sum up, I’m having a horrible time here…. Just kidding. I absolutely love it here and really see myself working for this company in the future. I have met so many people and every single one of them, after hearing what I will be doing, says that it’s something they really need and that they are really excited to have me here for the summer. I am hoping I can leave my mark in a positive way and leave this company with a much more user-friendly program. That’s not to say that what they have now is completely bad. There are just a lot of things that could be improved that aren’t really a priority. However, now that I am here and have the skill set to complete these things, the program will undoubtedly get much better and more team members will start using it. I probably won’t be writing an article like this every week but since this is the start of the internship, I thought it would be best to summarize everything that’s going on. I hope you enjoyed it!</p>
