			<h1>My Issue With Ads</h1>
			<span>December 27th, 2016</span>
			<p>I would first like to say that I am an avid user of an ad blocker while I am on the internet. I apologize to anyone who relies on ad revenue as their income but they have become so intrusive that not having an ad blocker on severely diminishes my online experience. It has gotten to the point where many sites now completely sacrifice their user experience just to increase ad revenue. For what it’s worth, I thought I would weigh in.</p>
			<p>Through my position as a project manager at SNworks, I would design and manage a lot of student media websites for universities across the country. Going through the design process, without fail, the leading motivator was ads. How can I design this new website that both creates a great experience for the user but also satisfies the clients’ need for 5 different ad spots on the homepage. It was tough and unfortunately due to the nature of working with clients, they are always right and you ultimately have to adhere to their desires and needs. This meant sacrificing the design and ultimately the user experience and I am almost never a fan of that.</p>
			<p>Ad revenue, in many situations, is the only source of revenue for a website. It’s how they make their living and how they keep the lights on. I get that. However, I also believe that you are hindering your clients and are probably losing some business. I’ll give you an example. Say I have my ad blocker off and I go to a news article that is riddled with ads. But, they aren’t just any ads, they are the ads that take up half the page, push the content all around and are just overall annoying. I can tell you right now that I will leave that site, find that news article somewhere else and read that article on a site that doesn’t put the content second. That’s how you lose business - even though your ad revenue is supposed to be the source of income you depend on.</p>
			<p>The other thing ads “ruin” is the overall accessibility of your website. Accessibility is something I have talked about a couple times on my website and is something I am very passionate about. If you have ads that are moving content around, taking up the entire screen and just getting in the way, you are jeopardizing the experience of someone who may be interacting with your website through any assistive technology.</p>
			<p>Like I mentioned, I understand how important ads are to any online business. I am in no way saying to get rid of ads completely. I am advocating for a change in execution when it comes to online ads. The best way to overhaul ads is to (no brainer) think like a user. Have someone outside of your company/office go through your site without any ad blockers and just measure their level of frustration. If they are anything like me, I will gladly voice my frustration if your ads are overpowering the content of your website that I initially came to see. I didn’t travel to your website to admire your use of full page ads or in-content video ads. I came to your website to read your content as will all of your other users. Your content and your user experience should not be compromised due to ads.</p>
