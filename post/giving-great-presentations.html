			<h1>Giving Great Presentations</h1>
			<span>April 10th, 2016</span>
			<p>The article this week is going to be very subjective and I’ll start it out by saying that. Everyone is different and my advice on giving a great presentation might be completely useless to someone else. However, I have had the opportunity to give quite a few presentations not only for classes but at conferences as well. Throughout these opportunities I have been able to perfect my public speaking skills and have gotten really good and comfortable with giving presentations to a group of people.</p>
			<p>My first piece of advice is to pick a topic, if you have that control, that you are passionate about. For me, giving a presentation on something that I really enjoy or am really passionate about, makes the presentation go that much better as I know for certain the information I am talking about is true and important. As mentioned, I have given quite a few presentations and most of them have been about accessibility which is something I have a job in. Giving presentations on this type of information has gotten incredible easy due to the fact that I am working with it almost everyday. I know that every bullet on my slides is the direct result of several tests and a lot of hands on experience.</p>
			<p>On the other hand, if the topic isn’t something that you are passionate about, it’s important to do your research before the presentation. When I first had to give presentations, I would do the bare minimum to prepare. I would research just enough to get information on the slides. This made for some really awkward presentations as people would have questions that I couldn’t answer. Additionally, it was very clear that I was reading right from the slides and there was no freedom in my presentation and the reactions in the audience gave that away.</p>
			<p>Another piece of advice for giving presentations would be to not focus so much on the design of the slides. Before my job as an accessibility specialist, I would worry so much about how my presentation looked and made sure the transitions looked great but in the end, they don’t always matter. People in the audience aren’t going to walk away from your presentation thinking about how well you transitioned from slide to slide. Yes, the overall design is important, but if you find yourself spending a couple hours on how it looks, something I have done myself, you’re probably overthinking it. Focus on the content and then throw a nice, applicable theme on it and let the program do the design work for you.</p>
			<p>To continue, it’s also very important to practice your presentation before the big day, especially if the presentation is timed. I know this sounds really cliché but it is crucial to a great presentation. Yes, you were the one that created the presentation and yes, the slides will be right in front of you when you present, but still practice. Practice what you are going to add onto each piece of information and how it’s all going to flow. If the presentation is timed, time yourself while you are practicing to make sure you don’t go over. I have had a couple presentations that will cut you off if you go over the allotted time and you want to make sure that you’re able to get all of your information out.</p>
			<p>Now, I know that every presentation is different and I mean who am I to give advice on how to give them. However, after the different presentations that I have given at conferences, in classrooms, to faculty members and many more, I thought it might be beneficial to at least throw my two cents in. For some, public speaking is a nightmare and that’s understandable but it gets much easier when you know what you are talking about and are as prepared as you can be. I presented at an undergraduate research forum at MSU recently and one of the judges said, “You all seem so calm.” In response, I said, “I think everyone in this room is presenting on something they are knowledgable and passionate about and it makes the presentation that much easier.” Everyone in the room agreed and it’s a great thing to remember.</p>
