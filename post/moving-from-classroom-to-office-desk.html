			<h1>Moving From Classroom to Office Desk</h1>
			<span>April 3rd, 2016</span>
			<p>I have held my current positions as a project manager and an accessibility specialist for a little over a year now and during that time I have learned a lot. Having these jobs has allowed me to directly apply everything that I am learning in my courses to my different positions. If I learn about a new project management methodology, I can go to my boss at The State News and talk with him about implementing it into our workflow. This ability, however, has taught me that everything I learn in my classes does not always transition nicely to the industry. This idea is what I wanted to discuss today. There is no perfect world.</p>
			<p>I recently was asked to read an article for a class that explained different methods for project management and how these different methods could help maximize efficiency. The whole time I was reading the article, I couldn’t help but notice that this would never happen at The State News. Maybe it’s my position or the work that I do but everything that was discussed in the article seemed too ideal and too perfect for me to really take anything away from it. I then started realizing that the majority of my books on things like prototyping or project management had the same feel.</p>
			<p>To give you an example, the article mentioned above talked about doing a lot of planning and a lot of documentation early on to prevent having to do it all at the end of the project or the task. Now this works sometimes, yes, but it isn’t always the case and I will explain using our methods at The State News. When I get an email from one of our clients requesting a new feature, I first make sure that it is something that we can do and something that won’t incur an additional price and then I hand it off to the developer. According to this article, this is the time where I, as a project manager, should be planning the documentation that will supplement this new request — things like a step by step how-to. I should be sitting with the developer through the whole process so that by the time the feature is completed, I won’t have to spend much time trying to figure out how to use it and then writing up documentation for the client. Sounds like a great method and one that would save a bunch of time, right?</p>
			<p>Realistically though, it happens much differently. When I get that email, I still make sure that it’s something that we can do and have a brief discussion with the developer on the request. I normally will suggest how he/she goes about completing it and all of the details that he/she needs to know before starting to work on it. This is where things get different. Between the time that the developer starts working on it and the time that I get the notification that it has been completed, a lot of things change. The developer may have thought of something much better or easier to do after we had our conversation or it might even be that we can’t do it all. Sure I can sit in with the developer every time he/she works on it to constantly keep up to date but that slows not only the developer down as they have to explain everything but it also prevents me from doing the rest of my tasks.</p>
			<p>My point in this article is not to say that the textbooks are wrong and that they shouldn’t be valued when it comes to the industry you will be working in. However, it is important to note that everything that is written in those books won’t be able to be directly transferred to your job. It’s important to be able to adjust and use those methods as a guideline or a starting point. I recently started training a new project manager at The State News and as I was explaining our methodologies he asked me if there were any tutorials that he could read up on to understand how to use these different methods. I explained that though there are tutorials on how to use the different programs, there aren't any tutorials on the methods we use because each company implements them in a different way. The basics might be the same but each company will tweak, add and remove different elements to best suit their needs and this is why flexibility is so important.</p>
			<p>I have learned so many things from all of the classes that I have taken so far in college but being able to apply those ideas and lessons outside of the classroom has been much more valuable. Learning about these methodologies is very important but as mentioned, you must be flexible when actually implementing them.</p>
