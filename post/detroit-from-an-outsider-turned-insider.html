			<h1>Detroit: From an Outsider Turned Insider</h1>
			<span>June 23rd, 2016</span>
			<p>I’m taking a break this time to write a more editorial type post. Instead of this being about my internship with Quicken Loans, I want to talk about the city my internship is in: Detroit. No matter who you are or where you’re from, everyone seems to have their preconceived ideas of Detroit. I’ve only been here for 7 weeks now but I wanted to give my take.</p>
			<p>First, let’s talk about my background. As most know, I come from a very small town in Northern Michigan. The town is just over 2,000 people strong and the diversity is almost non-existent. East Jordan only became more diverse when we decided to accept over 15 foreign exchange students each school year. Growing up in East Jordan, I had my ideas of Detroit without ever being there. Detroit is about 4.5/5 hours from East Jordan and it wasn’t a trip people took unless they were going to a sports game or a big-name concert. Growing up, Detroit was synonymous with crime and drugs and rightfully so. At that time, Detroit was experiencing the worst decline in the entire nation. Losing well over a million people while the auto industry, the reason Detroit is Detroit, couldn’t get out from under itself. However, these beliefs aren’t necessarily true today but the image of Detroit seems to still be attached to it.</p>
			<p>From East Jordan I moved to East Lansing which if you’re not aware, is home to the greatest university in the nation (bias?), Michigan State University. I quickly went from a very small, rural town to the 8th largest university in the country right outside the Michigan's capital. East Lansing gave me a glimpse of city life. I finally had a Meijer down the street and I had fast food chains I had never heard of right outside my door. This was also around the same time that Detroit came to grips with its situation and filed for bankruptcy: the largest municipality to do so. I quickly became fascinated with the state of Detroit and wanted so desperately to see it succeed again. Don’t ask me why I fell for Detroit because I honestly don’t know but I did and have been researching the city's comeback ever since.</p>
			<p>This leads me to the position I am today. I'm writing this blog post from a dorm at Wayne State University right outside the city’s growing downtown. Since living and working in downtown Detroit, I have really been able to see what the media has been talking about - or not talking about - for all of these years. Detroit is coming back. Well the downtown is coming back. Right now, I challenge you to find a road in the downtown area that has all lanes open. Woodward has a new light rail going in and a ton of other streets have lanes closed to allow construction workers uninterrupted access to all of the buildings being renovated throughout the city.</p>
			<p>Now, before I get into everything else that Detroit is doing, I wanted to bring up the fact that not everything is picture perfect. If you venture outside of the downtown bubble as I do everyday to go to the Planet Fitness on the corner of 8 mile and Woodward, you quickly see that the rebuilding is not equal. There are several buildings just waiting to fall down. Buildings that have more graffiti on them than windows. These areas are the ones the media loved to talk about a few years ago when Detroit was still going down.</p>
			<p>The reason I bring up the other side is because there are people out there, especially natives of these areas, that claim we, people who stay mainly downtown, don’t know a thing about Detroit. That all we know is downtown and that downtown does not represent the entire city. To that, I completely agree. Detroit still needs A TON of work to fully comeback from its bankruptcy. The school system, the roads, the abandoned houses and crime all come to mind first. Detroit cannot continue to rebuild if families are unwilling to put their children in the school system. Why move into the city where my child is statistically going to get a worse education than if I were to just stay in the suburbs? These are the things Detroit needs to fix in order to continue its renaissance.</p>
			<p>Another hot topic in Detroit is the claim that developers are pushing lower-class natives out of the city. New apartments and full neighborhoods are being built all around the downtown area and many are up in arms that this is at the expense of lower-class citizens who have been in the city their entire lives. They are continuously being pushed further and further out as rents for these apartments skyrocket as supply tries to keep up with demand. These claims are, for the most part, true but that doesn’t mean nothing is being done about it.</p>
			<p>If you take a step back and look at the entire nation, this is happening everywhere. If I want to get an apartment in downtown Chicago I’m going to be paying about $2.50 per square foot. If you want to pay less than that, you look outside of the downtown area. The same can be said for Detroit and trust me, I have looked. Apartments in the Detroit go, right now, for about $2 per square foot whereas the surrounding areas are much cheaper. Additionally, a set percentage of all apartment developments receiving public money must be set aside for lower income families which is probably a lot more than can be said for other cities. So while the native citizens might not be able to afford the same places as they could a decade ago, it’s no different from any other major city.</p>
			<p>In other areas, Detroit is doing a lot to help brighten up the city. In fact, on the 27th of June, I will be volunteering all day for a program called Motown Musters working to clean up a park on the city’s outer edges. There are countless programs like Motown Musters who want to see Detroit come back. Everyone shares the common goal of getting Detroit back to the city it once was. Coming to Detroit I knew I wanted to get out and experience more of the city that isn’t so heavily publicized. I wanted to experience all of Detroit and I feel volunteering for organizations such as these will help do that. These organizations aren’t doing what they are doing for the publicity, they just generally want to help out.</p>
			<p>In conclusion, Detroit isn’t the same city everyone thinks of. Every day there are hundreds if not thousands of people in the downtown area. People gathering at the park in the center of the city listening to the free, live music or lining up to grab something from the food trucks or even just to walk around and browse the many new stores and restaurants that have opened up within the past few years. Detroit even has a brand new stadium going up right next to the other world class stadiums of Ford Field and Comerica Park. There may be a ways to go for Detroit to become what it wants to be but it’s on its way. Detroit needs help, though, and it’s very rewarding to be involved even if it’s going to clean up a park.</p>
