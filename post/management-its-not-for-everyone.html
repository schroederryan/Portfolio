			<h1>Management: It's Not For Everyone</h1>
			<span>March 20th, 2016</span>
			<p>Through the many different positions I have held throughout my life and the many different managers that have come with those positions, I have learned one thing: management isn’t for everyone. There are some people that love managing other people and different projects/products and there are some that just don’t. Neither case is bad, though it’s important to find out whether you like managing or not before you have an actual job as a manager.</p>
			<p>This idea become clear to me when I was working at a restaurant in Northern Michigan for a summer. We had three different managers that would all work at different times and employees definitely had their favorite. To me, a manager of a restaurant is the one basically keeping everything under control. They’re the ones talking with customers making sure they are satisfied, helping out the wait staff if they need anything, making drinks for the bartenders if they are busy and essentially lending a hand wherever it is needed throughout the day. We had one manager that did all of for every single shift, one manager that spent the majority of his shift eating the variety of dishes we served and one that would get “caught up” in hour long conversations with his buddies that were eating in the dining room. I’m not trying to bash any of them at their jobs, but managing a restaurant or anything for that matter isn’t something everyone is capable of doing.</p>
			<p>To continue, when I was in my project management class my sophomore year of college, the same idea surfaced. There were some students in the class that very clearly didn’t like the idea of management and voiced that frequently. There were others, however, that took it very seriously and made sure everyone in their group was doing what they were supposed to be doing and that deadlines were met. I found this type of class to be extremely beneficial as it solidified my interest in management and helped others realize that this is nowhere near what they want to be doing with their lives.</p>
			<p>Now, I got interested in management pretty young because I’m a very curious person and sometimes a little too nosey. This might be a bad thing and I’m honestly not sure if it is but it helped me to get the project manager position I have now. I like knowing what is going on and helping people out in anyway that I can. At my current position, I am constantly giving input to the designers and listening to what the developers have to say about how something should function. I know that my ideas aren’t always the only ideas and I like having the opportunity to discuss those with the whole team. I don’t view myself as any higher than anyone else on the team and I think that that is important. I am just as much a part of the team as anyone else and with effective communication, we create much better products.</p>
			<p>As with almost anything else, you can be taught how to do something but until you have that passion, you’re not going to be the best you could be at it. For example, you can teach me everything about chemistry but that’s not going to mean I’m going to be interested in it or even good at it (trust me, my chemical engineering roommate has tried). The same can be said for management. You can learn all of the methodologies on project management and learn all about communication but if it’s not something you’re interested in, you’re not going to be the effective manager every business is looking for.</p>
			<p>I strive to be the best manager I can be by learning and applying things I have learned in class and because I am genuinely interested in the work. Being a manager means a lot of things ride on your shoulders and a lot of things are at risk and for some reason, that intrigues me. I enjoy the sense of accomplishment when the developers, designers and myself created a great website that the client loves. I also enjoy the lessons learned when a launch doesn’t go according to plan or the challenge in working with a difficult client. I hope to be in many more management roles and will be getting my project management certification before I graduate in the spring of 2017 to learn and grow as a manager in this field.</p>
