			<h1>Quicken Loans: Week 6</h1>
			<span>June 17th, 2016</span>
			<p>To start off, it was a terrible idea waiting this long to write another blog post about my internship at Quicken Loans. I wrote about my first week, which you can <a href="/post/quicken-loans-week-one">read about here</a>, but haven’t written since. Since that time, though, so much has happened that I have no idea how I am going to include it all in a blog post that you’re not reading until next year. In short, however, things are still going extremely well here and I absolutely love my team and this company even more than I did after week one.</p>
			<p>To start out, let me discuss some bigger things I have been doing. The program I'm working on gets several hundred thousand unique visitors every month so I have the opportunity to make a huge impact with just about everything I do. One of the big things I was asked to do was to create a new, very complicated gadget. This new gadget is one that has actually been asked about for over a year now and they wanted me to take the reins for my first big project. One of the reasons it hadn’t been completed before was because it’s so complicated and it’s actually the most complicated gadget in terms of coding and requirements our team has made so far. With that said, it was very overwhelming at first to take this on. However, I have been able to complete it in just 4 weeks. The gadget is set to go live on Thursday, June 23rd and I am very excited about the impact this gadget is going to have on our company and it’s something that I created.</p>
			<p>This gadget then leads me into the next big thing I am going to be doing in the next week. The larger team I am a part of sends out a video everyday that is sort of like an interview with the different teams. I have the opportunity to be "interviewed" for a video regarding the stuff I have been doing. On Tuesday, June 21st, I will be talking with another person on my team about the gadget that I created as well as another gadget deployed a month ago created by the other team member. This is an incredible opportunity because I will not only be able to talk freely about what I created but it's normally viewed by several thousand people and is sent out by our vice president. I will be able to talk about something I put a lot of work into for a couple weeks in front of 4,000 people within the company and I am just an intern. I know there are a lot of interns that don’t have this type of opportunity and I’m very excited for that day.</p>
			<p>The last major thing I will discuss before I get into some other things going on during my internship is a survey that I created. A big part of user experience is getting user feedback and I figured a very easy way to do that would be to create a survey and send it out to all the users. Little did I know, this was the first time my team had ever created a survey of any kind so this was really going to be able to give us a lot of insight straight from our users' mouth. We went back and forth on this for a good week on the wording of questions and the order but the survey finally went out this past week. It was sent out again by our vice president and went out to just about 6,500 people. Within seconds we had more responses than any other survey I had ever created combined. However, it was amazing to be able to get the feedback directly from our users on things to improve. That is, in the end, why I was given the internship and I want to make sure I come up with ways to do that. I will be going through the results more thoroughly next week and will summarize the information to then take to the rest of my team.</p>
			<p>To take a step back from some of the bigger things I have been working on, I am still loving this company as a whole. They preach the “we’re a flat organization” and that is completely true. One of the CEO’s of one of our “Family of Companies” created this organizational tool called <a href="http://www.justsift.com/">Sift</a> that allows you to search for anyone in the organization by their name, team, skill, etc. When they deployed it to our whole company, I had a question about something and decided to reach out to the CEO. I sent him an email asking him about the question and he responded to my email within the next day. That example proves that they are, in fact, a flat organization. Most high level people within a company won’t respond to emails like that and I thought it was really cool.</p>
			<p>I also had the opportunity to go to a Tigers game with the rest of my team. To reiterate, I was paid to go out and enjoy a Tigers game on a beautiful 75 degree day with my entire team. It was a lot of fun and it really allowed me to get to know my team on a much more personal level. Yeah you can spend the whole day with them in the office but that’s in the office. Everyone is in work mode in the office and getting to step out for half a day allowed me to get to know them that much better.</p>
			<p>Finally, I am shadowing the user experience team for 8 different sessions throughout the next few weeks. I reached out to them and told them that my background and in fact my major was in user experience and they were very kind to not only set up one, one hour block but to set up 8, one hour blocks with each person of their team. This was huge because I can get my name out to that team which only helps in networking as well as learn more about their different skills. This is the team dedicated to doing everything that I am doing in my team but for the entire company. They do a lot with our client facing websites to make sure they are the best that they can be. It’s been really cool learning from them about how user experience is applied in such a large scale.</p>
			<p>I think I will stop there and try to write more as the summer progresses. I am in love with Quicken Loans and really can see myself working here when I get out of school. I have told just about everyone on my team that if the rest of the summer goes anything close to how the first part has, it’s going to be really difficult to go back to school. I truly don’t want to leave especially when I have a lot of projects going on. I really would like to be around when all of these projects get deployed. I will undoubtedly have input on all of these projects and it would be great if it could go live before I have to say, “See ya later” (see what I did there). I love MSU and I am really looking forward to my senior year, don’t get me wrong, I just absolutely love this company and don’t want to leave - at least not right now.</p>
