			<h1>Learning Tech in a Tech-less community</h1>
			<span>February 21st, 2016</span>
			<p>Growing up in a small town has many perks: knowing every person in your class of 76, knowing each of your teachers on a more personal level and getting that feeling that you are more than just a number in their system. On the other hand, there are some downsides: your parents know exactly what you’re doing at all times and will hear about things before you can tell them, the small town rumors and most importantly, the lack of opportunities.</p>
			<p>When I graduated, East Jordan High School didn’t offer a single AP class. Thankfully that has changed as of this posting but those options were never available to me when I was a student. This set me back quite a bit when beginning my time at Michigan State University. Many of my friends had at least one university requirement covered from high school and some even had entire semesters covered while I came in starting from scratch. This, though, wasn’t the biggest issue I faced coming from a small school.</p>
			<p>As mentioned in a previous post, my major is in the technology field. However, due to the small size of my high school, these opportunities were never available to me. We didn’t have a technology class or anything even related to the career field I wanted to enter. Everything I learned about this field that I was going to be in for the rest of my life, I taught myself.</p>
			<p>While in high school, I would often, after school or even during school, learn more about this field and all of the different programs involved in this field. I learned how to code, how to design using Adobe’s creative suite and I built my first website in 2012, a year before I graduated high school. I wanted to see if this was something I was really interested in and if my high school wasn’t going to offer those opportunities, I was going to teach myself.</p>
			<p>After figuring out what I wanted to do in college, the next challenge of a small school arose. Trying to explain what programs in college I was looking for to my advisors was a big challenge. Many didn’t have the right knowledge of the field to guide me in the right direction and left me to do most of the research on my own. My choice of college was an easy one but I had to figure out which major suited me the best, all on my own.</p>
			<p>I have always been independent and a fast learner and I credit most of that to my parents. My parents, while I was in high school, bought me the software I needed and the domain for my first website and really enabled me to learn about this field when my high school couldn’t. Though I would have loved at least one class in high school, the challenge to learn this all on my own has really solidified my interest in the field and I wouldn’t change a thing.</p>
