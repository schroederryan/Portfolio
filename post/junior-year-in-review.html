			<h1>Junior Year In Review</h1>
			<span>April 29th, 2016</span>
			<p>I think the title kind of says it all but I’m honestly in shock. It’s hard to believe that I graduated high school three years ago and here I am starting to think about my last year at Michigan State University. From new site launches at SNworks to presentations at various conferences and even the countless heart attacks from watching the Spartans play, this year has been the best one yet and I am by no means ready to leave this great school.</p>
			<p>This past year has included a lot of firsts for me so lets start at the beginning of the year. I decided to move off campus with my best friends and I moved into my very first house. This move gave me even more freedom as I no longer had a resident assistant looking over me but this also meant I had to start making my own food — something I wasn’t really sure how I was going to enjoy. I stayed in East Lansing to continue working for SNworks as well as occasionally doing work for the College of Arts and Letters as they needed me.</p>
			<p>Moving on with the semester, in November I gave my first presentation at a conference. The College of Arts and Letters hosted a conference on accessibility titled “Making Learning Accessible” and my boss asked if I would give a talk. Because this was my first presentation, I didn’t want “go big” right away so I decided to give a 15 minute talk on how to make HTML forms more accessible. Accessibility is something I am very passionate about and I hope to give another, more in depth presentation at next years conference.</p>
			<p>Straying away from academics a little bit, in early December I had the privilege of attending the Big Ten championship game in Indianapolis with Michigan State, winners of the East division, playing against Iowa, winners of the West division. This was my first time in Indianapolis and we made sure to make a day out of it. Though we had to wait in line for our tickets for probably 3 hours, the experience was well worth it. Michigan State ended up winning in dramatic fashion and I believe this was my 4th near heart attack of the year (not really but you know).</p>
			<p>Additionally, in late December, like as late as December goes, I got to go to Dallas for the Cotton Bowl. Michigan State was playing Alabama in the second annual College Football Playoff and I had the incredible opportunity to go. This was my first time in Texas and the first time seeing “Jerry’s World” (AT&T Stadium) and let me tell you it did not disappoint. The stadium is monstrous, the scoreboard is huge, the whole thing was absolutely incredible. We don’t need to discuss the outcome of the game because I mean who really cares (MSU lost 38-0). This was an experience I will never forget.</p>
			<p>Also around this time I launched this portfolio website. I wanted a place that I could showcase who I am and though it took me a lot longer than I wanted, I am happy with what I have created. I coded this website entirely on my own and I think it makes it that much more personal. This site will continue to live on as an insight into my life as I continue to write about things that I am passionate about and things that are going on in my life.</p>
			<p>At the start of the spring semester, my client, <a href="http://www.dailycardinal.com/">The Daily Cardinal</a> of the University of Wisconsin - Madison was launching their site and this was my biggest client to date. I had worked all semester during the fall to design and manage a website that they wanted and would use for years to come. Though it was a long process that involved many different tweaks and iterations, everyone was happy with the final product.</p>
			<p>Skipping ahead a little bit, in early April I was given the opportunity to give another presentation on Accessibility. This presentation was part of <a href="http://www.urca.msu.edu/uuraf">UURAF</a> which is a university wide research forum for undergraduates to showcase their research. I talked about accessibility and how the methodologies of remediation that I have created for the College of Arts and Letters has impacted the college as well as myself. I was able to talk about the need for creating accessible content and what that means for the university as a whole.</p>
			<p>To sum up my year, I was awarded SNworks employee of the year as well as offered an internship with Quicken Loans this summer. I won’t be writing as much this summer due to the change in location and the overall change in lifestyle that this internship is going to force me into but I will keep everyone updated on social media. I was also offered a mentorship position through the College of Arts and Letters helping incoming freshmen as they work to make the transition from high school to college that will start in the fall. This year has been incredible and I am eternally grateful for the opportunities that I have been given. I look forward to my last year and I just hope that it slows down a little bit. I may be a fast paced individual but I want to enjoy my last year as a student.</p>
