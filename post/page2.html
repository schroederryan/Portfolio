			<h2><a href="/post/moving-from-classroom-to-office-desk">Moving From Classroom to Office Desk</a></h2>
			<span>April 3rd, 2016</span>
			<p>I have held my current positions as a project manager and an accessibility specialist for a little over a year now and during that time I have learned a lot. Having these jobs has allowed me to directly apply everything that I am learning in my courses to my different positions. If I learn about a new project management methodology, I can go to my boss at The State News and talk with him about implementing it into our workflow. This ability, however, has taught me that everything I learn in my classes does not always transition nicely to the industry. This idea is what I wanted to discuss today. There is no perfect world.</p>

			<h2><a href="/post/technical-communication-in-project-management">Technical Communication in Project Management</a></h2>
			<span>March 27th, 2016</span>
			<p>I approach technical communication as a type of management style that allows all members of the team, including the technical communicator, to understand the full process of the project. I approach this as a way to communicate more effectively to the client as well as the team members and also ensuring that product that is being created is not only useful but is understood by the client. For example, doing research into how the client will be using the product will allow me, as a technical communicator, to better assess what functions need to be communicated to the client and ensuring nothing gets left out that would make it hard for them to use the product.</p>

			<h2><a href="/post/management-its-not-for-everyone">Management: It&rsquo;s Not for Everyone</a></h2>
			<span>March 20th, 2016</span>
			<p>Through the many different positions I have held throughout my life and the many different managers that have come with those positions, I have learned one thing: management isn&rsquo;t for everyone. There are some people that love managing other people and different projects/products and there are some that just don’t. Neither case is bad, though it’s important to find out whether you like managing or not before you have an actual job as a manager.</p>

			<h2><a href="/post/how-i-ended-up-here">How I Ended Up Here</a></h2>
			<span>March 13th, 2016</span>
			<p>I decided to take a different approach to this post and talk about the different things that have led me to be where I am today. I have had a lot of incredible opportunities in my 20 short years and all of these experiences have led me to the major that I am in and the job title I currently hold. From my parents, trips across the world, teachers in high school and professors in college and even different organizations, I have had a multitude of influences so far.</p>

			<h2><a href="/post/include-the-user-in-user-experience">Include the User in User Experience</a></h2>
			<span>March 6th, 2016</span>
			<p>When I wrote the article about my major, I explained a little bit about why user experience is so important. The user is ultimately what makes or breaks a business and that idea is something that needs to be addressed way before the product or business is even launched. One of the reasons I personally love Wikipedia, is it is so easy to use. They have all relevant information on one page broken up in easy to understand sections. You can search for a person and their age, relationship status, career as well as other information are right at the center because that is, most of the time, what users are going there to find out. If Wikipedia could be considered as a reliable source for research papers, let’s just say that it would be the only thing included in my bibliography.</p>

			<h2><a href="/post/employers-dont-hire-based-on-grades">Employers Don't Hire Based On Grades</a></h2>
			<span>February 28th, 2016</span>
			<p>Going through high school, the only thing I was worried about was getting into the college of my dreams - Michigan State University. I made sure to do all of my homework, get the best grades that I could, be involved in as many clubs as I could and really do anything that would ensure my acceptance to MSU. When I entered college, I expected it to be much of the same. Focus on school, get good grades, be involved and you will be rewarded with a great job when you graduate. However, about halfway through my first year, after speaking with career advisors and my own academic advisor, I realized I was approaching college all wrong. While none of them came out and said it (they work for the university, they are supposed to tell you to get good grades), I realized that employers really don’t care about your grades. They don’t care that you got a 2.5 in Bio instead of the 3.5 or 4.0 you were hoping for. All they want to see is that you have the experience to make you qualified for the job you’re applying for.</p>

			<h2><a href="/post/learning-tech-in-a-tech-less-community">Learning Tech in a Tech-less Community</a></h2>
			<span>February 21st, 2016</span>
			<p>Growing up in a small town has many perks: knowing every person in your class of 76, knowing each of your teachers on a more personal level and getting that feeling that you are more than just a number in their system. On the other hand, there are some downsides: your parents know exactly what you’re doing at all times and will hear about things before you can tell them, the small town rumors and most importantly, the lack of opportunities.</p>

			<h2><a href="/post/what-is-experience-architecture">What is "Experience Architecture"</a></h2>
			<span>February 14th, 2016</span>
			<p>As a college student, I am no stranger to the typical “college student” questions. Questions like, “what is your major?” “what do you want to do after you graduate?” are questions I get every time I travel back home for a weekend or meet someone new. Now these questions wouldn’t be so bad if I were an engineering student or an athletic training major or something more easily described but that is not the case for my major. After telling people my major is experience architecture, a common response is, “so you design buildings, right?” To answer bluntly, no I don’t.</p>

			<h2><a href="/post/a-web-for-everyone">A Web For Everyone</a></h2>
			<span>February 7th, 2016</span>
			<p>Since starting my job as an accessibility intern through the College of Arts and Letters (CAL) here at Michigan State University, I have learned a lot about accessibility and how it pertains to the web. Quite honestly, I’m pretty disgusted by the lack of progress. I think a lot of this has to do with the mindset people have about accessibility and the web. A lot of people think that making your content accessible to every user, regardless of the disability or lack thereof, is really hard to do. That, however, is just not true - if you begin with accessibility in mind.</p>
