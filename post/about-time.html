			<h1>About Time...</h1>
			<span>November 13th, 2016</span>
			<p>First off, to my family, I in no way intended this to be the way you found out. However, due to the recent elections and all that has unfolded in the past few days, I feel this was the time to not hide in fear but instead come out and be proud of who I am and I hope you understand that. I love you all and in no way thought you would think any different of me and in no way feared having the conversation — you’re my family and I know you better than that. This was simply what I thought was best given the circumstances and the time commitment required to call each and every one of you. And, based on comments you all have said, I’m sure you had an idea anyway.</p>
			<p>I am bisexual. I have known and accepted this for a while now but never felt it necessary to come out and say. Here’s why: I am so much more than that. Being bisexual is a part of me, yes, and I am proud of that part of me; however, I have done and accomplished incredible things in 21 years because i’m independent, dedicated, driven, focused and everything else that I attribute to who I am. If you are to label me as anything, those are more fitting than bisexual.</p>
			<p>For my family that will undoubtedly have questions, I have known for a while. I had an idea going through high school but figured it was best to just get through it continuing to think I was simply straight. Getting to college is when I started accepting who I really was. I met new people that I could be upfront with right from the start, I was on my own and free to do whatever it was I wanted. I have avoided these types of conversations with you all until now because I wasn’t ready and didn’t feel the need. I continued to hide it because I believed and still do to an extent that my soulmate was a woman. I convinced myself that I didn’t need to say anything because I was going to end up with a woman so why did it matter. Looking back, it was so wrong. Regardless of who I end up with, this is who I am and I am at a point in my life where I have embraced it.</p>
			<p>To my friends that I haven’t told, this is by no means a way of me telling you I thought you were going to treat me differently or any of that. Again, I just didn’t see the need to make it public until all of this in our country started happening. So far, I have not had a bad experience in telling anyone and for that I am grateful and I hope it continues, though I don’t really care if you don’t agree.</p>
			<p>Digging deeper into why I chose now to come out is because many believe, according to my very reliable Facebook (sarcasm), that the fact that I am a white male means that I can’t even begin to imagine the struggles and harassment marginalized citizens around the country are facing. This, however, is not the case as I, myself, have felt the pain of being judged solely on my looks, even when I was a “straight” white male.</p>
			<p>I have told this story several times after it happened but I have always left out one thing that I am now okay sharing. A couple years ago, while walking at night with a friend, I was approached by a man who clearly was on some sort of drug. He bumped up against my chest, murmured something to me, stepped back and slapped me right across the face. That is the story I have always told people. The truth, however, is I know exactly what he said. The full story is he bumped up against my chest, said, “you wanna f*** homo?”, stepped back and slapped me across the face. I was not holding hands with a guy, kissing a guy or anything that would make him think I was anything but straight yet he still felt the need to say what he did and slap me.</p>
			<p>Directly after the incident, I was fine and was actually able to laugh it off quite quickly. My jaw hurt partially from the slap and from the fact that I just had my wisdom teeth removed a couple days earlier but other than that, I was unharmed - thankfully. Mentally, I was pretty shaken up but also fine. I’ve seen my parents deal with people like this and I have grown up knowing not to let things like this get to you. I did, though, question a lot that night about who I was and what I stood for. At this point, I was still coming to grips with my sexuality and this did no favors. In the end, it didn’t affect me at all. I’m a very determined person and stuff like that has never gotten to me for very long.</p>
			<p>To be clear, I didn't share this for sympathy or support or to draw any attention to myself. I was fine right after it happened and I'm fine now. I share this because this is just one instance out of quite a few that I have had and it shows that hate, while more apparent to marginalized citizens, happens to all. With the current situation our country is facing, it’s important now more than ever to stand up for what you believe in, let no one and nothing stand in the way of achieving your goals, and continue to love everyone equally. I know what it’s like to be blindly slapped while trying to enjoy your night. I know what it’s like to fear walking down the street alone. This is not what America stands for. Regardless of our president, respect one another and work hard for the things you believe in. America will get through these seemingly impossible times but we must do it together. United.</p>
			<p>I will end with the fact that I was quite literally shaking when I was writing the first part of this post. As I sit here writing this last paragraph, I am more inspired and driven than I ever have been. I have never been happier than I am at this moment in my life and in no way want to make this a big deal. I'm in the best shape of my life, I’m finishing up my last year of college at the school I dreamed of attending my entire life, have a full time job lined up with a company I absolutely love working for, and will be speaking in front of hundreds next month on learning management systems and how to make online education more accessible and user friendly. I will be leaving this post up for only a couple days as this does not reflect the idea of my portfolio website. I love you all and thank you for the continued support.</p>
