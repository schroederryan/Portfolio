			<h1>A Web for Everyone</h1>
			<span>February 7th, 2016</span>
			<p>Since starting my job as an accessibility intern through the College of Arts and Letters (CAL) here at Michigan State University, I have learned a lot about accessibility and how it pertains to the web. Quite honestly, I’m pretty disgusted by the lack of progress. I think a lot of this has to do with the mindset people have about accessibility and the web. A lot of people think that making your content accessible to every user, regardless of the disability or lack thereof, is really hard to do. That, however, is just not true - if you begin with accessibility in mind.</p>
			<p>Sure, there are things that can be time consuming such as restructuring your whole website to ensure headings are used correctly or making sure there is alternative text on every image on your website but these things should have been done from the start. Making your digital content accessible to those with a disability doesn’t just make it easier for them to navigate through your content but it also helps every other user as well. For example, ensuring that links accurately describe the location of the links doesn’t just help a user reading through content through a screen reader, but can also help every other user know exactly what the link is and where it goes. Too many times digital content writers will include of a link of “here” and that doesn’t tell anyone anything about the link</p>
			<p>Additionally, creating accessible content greatly widens your user base. Say you have a small, online shop that sells handmade hats. These might be the best hats in the world but someone with a disability that can’t correctly navigate your site will undoubtedly get frustrated and take their business elsewhere. I don’t know of many businesses that would close their doors to willing customers and that’s essentially what happens when digital content is not created in an accessible way.</p>
			<p>As the web gets more and more advanced, it is imperative we create content that is accessible to everyone. Take the extra time at the beginning to create your site the right way instead of having to go back months or even years after and remediate. This ties right in with starting with an accessibility mindset. If you understand from the beginning why accessible content is important it makes actually creating accessible content that much easier.</p>
