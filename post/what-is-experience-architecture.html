			<h1>What is "Experience Architecture"</h1>
			<span>March 27th, 2016</span>
			<p>As a college student, I am no stranger to the typical “college student” questions. Questions like, “what is your major?” “what do you want to do after you graduate?” are questions I get every time I travel back home for a weekend or meet someone new. Now these questions wouldn’t be so bad if I were an engineering student or an athletic training major or something more easily described but that is not the case for my major. After telling people my major is experience architecture, a common response is, “so you design buildings, right?” To answer bluntly, no I don’t.</p>
			<p>The best way to describe experience architecture is to simply flip the two words - architecting experiences. If that didn’t clear things up, let me explain it further. Every application on every phone and every website has been designed in some way. A lot of research goes into why a website or an application looks and acts the way it does. Why are the tabs on Facebook at the bottom of the screen and not at the top? Well, when you are holding your phone, it is much easier to tap the bottom of the screen instead of the top. That is essentially what I do and what I will be doing after I graduate - figuring those kind of things out.</p>
			<p>In the height of the domain boom (companies and people alike scrambling to buy up domains to create their own websites) the focus was on simply getting content on the Internet. Now that that has all but run its course as just about everyone has some sort of digital presence, the focus has turned to making things more user-friendly. If you went to a website looking for specific information and that website wasn’t laid out in a user-friendly way, you wouldn’t be able to find your information and you likely wouldn’t be a returning visitor. That spells big trouble for businesses.</p>
			<p>This may seem like a pretty straightforward thing to fix but if that were the case, user experience (another term for experience architecture) would never have been born. A lot of research goes into how a user interacts with different information. I’m sure we can all think of our favorite website or our favorite app to use on a daily basis and the way that that app or website is laid out is no fluke. More often than not, before that website or application even got to your phone it was rigorously tested to make sure everything made sense and that users could easily find the information they came there to find.</p>
			<p>Now, user experience doesn’t have to just be websites or applications. User experience can be used in a variety of fields - part of the reason why it’s in such high demand right now. There are user experience designers, user experience researchers and many others - all with the same goal of enhancing the users experience of whatever the end product may be. A better user experience often means users will promote it themselves and there is no better marketing campaign than positive word of mouth. This in turn creates more users which results in more money for the company and I’m sure we are all well aware of how much businesses love their money.</p>
			<p>So next time your surfing the web or using one of millions of apps out there and find yourself thinking “this is really easy to use” or “this is a nice feature”, it was put there to make your experience the best it possibly could be.</p>
