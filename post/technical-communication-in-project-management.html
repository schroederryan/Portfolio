			<h1>Technical Communication in Project Management</h1>
			<span>March 27th, 2016</span>
			<p>I approach technical communication as a type of management style that allows all members of the team, including the technical communicator, to understand the full process of the project. I approach this as a way to communicate more effectively to the client as well as the team members and also ensuring that product that is being created is not only useful but is understood by the client. For example, doing research into how the client will be using the product will allow me, as a technical communicator, to better assess what functions need to be communicated to the client and ensuring nothing gets left out that would make it hard for them to use the product.</p>
			<p>Stanley Dicks (2011) argues that technical communicators can and should be the ones managing projects. At first, I wasn't necessarily behind this idea and didn't see the value in having a technical communicator/writer as a project manager. I understood, at the time, what technical communication was but I had no idea how a technical communicator could manage an entire project effectively. However, I found that a lot of the stuff mentioned by Dicks, I currently do. A big part of a management position is communication and that obviously has a big role in technical communication as well so it makes sense for a lot of the functions would overlap.</p>
			<p>Dicks discusses the different phases in the project lifecycle and a lot of them I agree with and I have had experience with. One of these phases was the planning phase. He argues “technical communicators devote a significant time to learning the organization’s goals for a project, studying the users and the tasks they will be performing with the product or service under development, and designing information products that meet the goals both of the internal organization and the external audience(s).” Now this is something I completely agree with because it involves the user in the product and that’s what my whole major is about. I will never understand how so many companies will create documents and products that are for users without actually including the user in the process.</p>
			<p>On the other hand, I don’t agree with everything that Dicks suggests. One thing in particular was that “It is important for technical communicators to seek information actively rather than to wait passively for it to be provided."" In an ideal world, yes that would be great to get that information early on. However, things always change. I have been in many situations where I will hand something off to a developer after discussing how they are going to complete the task or fix the feature and having the solution be completely different from what we discussed. As a manager, I wouldn’t get a lot of work done if every day I was checking in with the developers to see if the plan had change.</p>
			<p>To discuss further, at my position at the State News, we hand things off to the developers and generally have a quick discussion about how we think it’s going to get done. Then, when the issue has actually been fixed or the new feature has been added, the developer will add a comment to the ticket explaining how it was fixed or how the feature is to be used. I then relay that information to the client that brought it up in the future. Now, this may be viewed as just “pretty-ing up what the developer said” but I think there is value in that. I love our developers and they produce great work, but their explanations don’t always make sense. Or, if it makes sense to me, it might not make any sense to the client. This forces me to test it out and write up the clearest explanation I can so the client can understand what is going on.</p>
			<p>Additionally, as a project manager, I need to be able to facilitate the requests to the developers. Our developers are constantly busy either building sites or fixing bugs on the ones that we have always created and we like to get bugs fixed as quickly as possible. This sense of urgency has forced me to really slim down my explanations and to instead simply point them to an example of an error or try and explain it. This is where media can come into play as a technical communicator. Many of the times, I will read a client's issue and look on their site to see if I can see it for myself. If I can, I will normally take a quick screenshot and use that to relay the information to the developer. This greatly cuts down on time wasted going through comment after comment trying to figure out what is wrong on which part of the website.</p>
			<p>In my opinion, technical communication is critical to any project manager’s position. As a project manager, my main job is communication. I am, on a daily basis, communicating to the clients, to the developers, the designers and my boss about different aspects of my job. Every project manager should possess the skill of technical communication and be able to accomplish everything that a technical communicator has to do and accomplish it effectively. The technical communication skill set brings with it a lot of value and it is something that can definitely help in the lifecycle of a project and should be known by every project manager.</p>
