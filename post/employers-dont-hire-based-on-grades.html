			<h1>Employers Don't Hire Based On Grades</h1>
			<span>February 28th, 2016</span>
			<p>Going through high school, the only thing I was worried about was getting into the college of my dreams - Michigan State University. I made sure to do all of my homework, get the best grades that I could, be involved in as many clubs as I could and really do anything that would ensure my acceptance to MSU. When I entered college, I expected it to be much of the same. Focus on school, get good grades, be involved and you will be rewarded with a great job when you graduate. However, about halfway through my first year, after speaking with career advisors and my own academic advisor, I realized I was approaching college all wrong. While none of them came out and said it (they work for the university, they are supposed to tell you to get good grades), I realized that employers really don’t care about your grades. They don’t care that you got a 2.5 in Bio instead of the 3.5 or 4.0 you were hoping for. All they want to see is that you have the experience to make you qualified for the job you’re applying for.</p>
			<p>Now this may not be true for every major or every career field and I understand that but the principle still applies. I have been told time and time again by my parents, who both have owned their own business, as well as both of my bosses, that employers look more at the experiences that you have. They want to know if you have had prior experience doing what this job will have you do. For example, you can spend 10 years reading textbook after textbook and attending lecture after lecture on how to build an airplane but until you get out there and actually use your hands to build an airplane, you won’t be learning all that you could be learning.</p>
			<p>During my freshman year, I decided to not look for a job and instead focus on getting acclimated to college life. This is a decision I firmly stand by and looking back today, as a junior, I am still glad that I chose to thoroughly enjoy the independence of college without the responsibility of a job for my first year. When sophomore year came around, on the other hand, I knew that I had to find a job and put to use everything I had been learning in class. While I was initially looking for one job I landed two different jobs within a week of each other. I finally had the opportunity to use the skills that my professors had been teaching out in the workforce.</p>
			<p>Having a job during college is definitely a challenge and isn’t for everyone, but because of these jobs, I have opened up many more opportunities for myself not only while in college but in the future as well. My future employers will be able to see that I have direct experience designing websites and managing a team of developers to deliver a website on time. Yes, I have taken a class on project management but being able to use the skills taught in the class on real teams creating real products for real organizations across the country shows much more. The work force becomes more competitive with every year and I have to do the things I need to do to make myself stand out and show employers that I am the best for the job I am applying for.</p>
			<p>Since having jobs during college, I have approached my classes in a much different way. Before, much like high school, I was focused on learning the content and memorizing it for the tests. Now, as I near the final year of my college career, I learn the material and figure out how to apply these concepts to my jobs. How can I use this method in a way that will benefit the teams I manage at The State News? How is the accessibility of this new tool? Can everyone use it or is it something that still needs a lot of work? These are the qualities employers will look for in an applicant, not what grade you got in your first year writing class.</p>
