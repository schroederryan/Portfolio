			<h1>Why I Won't Apply for Unpaid Internships</h1>
			<span>April 20th, 2016</span>
			<p>I am a soon to be senior in college (wait ... am I really a senior already??) who is all to familiar with the internship process. I have two incredible jobs that are related to my field of interest but that doesn’t mean I don’t want something else. Each company is different and each position will give me a different experience which is why I have looked at internships for this summer. I have applied to countless companies across the country and countless different jobs within my field. However, if I am reading through the description of the position and see the word “unpaid” I immediately close the tab and move on.</p>
			<p>Like I mentioned, I am a college student and with that comes college student debt. I unfortunately am not in the position to essentially take almost 4 months off by just “gaining experience.” The summer months are a time for me to nurse my wounded bank account back to health only to be punctured again in the fall. Applying for an unpaid internship, no matter how great it is, leaves me with no money to pay for college and if I can’t pay for college then I won’t be able to get the degree in the field that you are trying to employ me for.</p>
			<p>At a time when college costs continue to rise while the demand for a college education also rises, it makes much more sense for me to return to my tourist-loving hometown in the summer and make over $10,000 waiting tables at a restaurant. It’s a choice I have encountered in previous summers and one that shouldn’t even be thought of. As students, it is crazy that we sometimes have to choose between great experience or financial stability. This brings me to my next point.</p>
			<p>In my opinion, and luckily this is my blog, I don’t think unpaid internships should even be offered. At the end of the day, I am still working for your organization and completing tasks that any other employee would and if I’m not, then why is the position offered in the first place? If I’m sacrificing a summer to sit in on meetings, grab coffees and answer phones, how is that going to benefit me in the long run as an employee? The young adults of my generation are constantly pushing the limits and innovating in ways that were unheard of even 2 years ago. Though we will likely be at the company a short summer, our ideas and our creativity should be valued the same as a full time employee.</p>
			<p>I understand this may come across as a little entitled or whiny but from someone who has worked hard for everything I’ve received, I think there needs to be a change. I don’t want this post to come across as “I’m too good for unpaid internships” but instead that unpaid internships as a whole should be a thing of the past. I’m not looking for organizations to hand out internships with great benefits and competitive wages, I simply believe the idea of organizations giving us “experience we should be thankful for” should end. Yes, by giving me an internship in a field that I will hopefully get a job in when I graduate gives me valuable hands on experience, but if college costs keep rising, you won’t have any student interns.</p>
