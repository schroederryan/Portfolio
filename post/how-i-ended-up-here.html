			<h1>How I Ended Up Here</h1>
			<span>March 13th, 2016</span>
			<p>I decided to take a different approach to this post and talk about the different things that have led me to be where I am today. I have had a lot of incredible opportunities in my 20 short years and all of these experiences have led me to the major that I am in and the job title I currently hold. From my parents, trips across the world, teachers in high school and professors in college and even different organizations, I have had a multitude of influences so far.</p>
			<p>Lets first talk about my parents and their willingness and support to let me do anything I set my mind to. When I was a junior in high school, a good friend of mine and myself had this idea to create a website and a business that would compile all of the events that were going around the area, Staying Social. The area that I grew up in was a small, tourist town in Northern Michigan and there wasn’t a lot for us to do. We realized that there really wasn’t one place that you could go to see everything that was going on. My parents were entrepreneurs of their own, both owning their own businesses at the time, and when I told them about the idea they were extremely supportive and wanted to do everything they could to help.</p>
			<p>My parents offered their expertise in business and helped come up with the name and even offered to pay for the domain and the software that was needed to create the website. This project was the first real experience I had with the web and creating a website and is really where I fell in love with the idea of web development. My friend and I started to come up with the idea and came up with a list of things we thought people would want to know (exposing me to the field of user experience at a young age, though I didn’t know it at the time). We compiled a list of sporting events for 15 different schools, movie times for 3 different theaters, any festivals within the surrounding areas and other “hotspots” we thought people might be interested in. Long story short, the site lasted for a couple months before we had to focus on school but this experience peaked my interest in the web and was heavily supported by my parents.</p>
			<p>My interest for management, on the other hand, came from a teacher I had my senior year of high school and a professor I had my sophomore year of college. Both educators taught a class on management one being on leadership and the other being specifically on project management. When I took the leadership class my senior year, it was the first time that it was offered and the teacher made it one of my favorite classes in all of high school. We learned a lot about how to not only be a leader but an effective leader— yes, there is a huge difference. With this class, we organized different pep rallies that I got to speak at along with other events throughout the school year that we helped plan and execute.</p>
			<p>My class on project management in college was a lot of the same except about the web and how to manage different groups of people and was also the first time it was offered. We had one project for the whole semester and every 4 weeks a different member of our group would take the position as the project manager. Throughout this class we learned a lot about different methodologies used throughout the industry such as Agile, SCRUM and Waterfall. We had deadlines that we had to meet and it was the project managers job to make sure those deadlines were met and deliverables were completed. During this course, I was given my position at The State News as a project manager which allowed me to directly apply what I was learning in the class to my job. This unique experience further solidified my interest in management as opposed to something like development.</p>
			<p>I have gotten a lot of questions regarding how I ended up where I am now and how I chose the major I did and that may seem like an easier question than it is. For me, this was kind of like a two step process. I fell in love with Michigan State at an early age and there was no university that was even a close second. I also found what I would like to do with the rest of my life early on because of the different experiences I was exposed to. This then left me to match the two. After hours of research into MSU’s programs and countless trips to my college advisor, I found my calling in experience architecture. From the time I started working on Staying-Social back when I was 16 to the time I stepped into my first major-related class, Intro to Experience Architecture, I knew what I wanted to do when I grew up.</p>
			<p>Having all of these incredible influences and experiences at an early age has reassured me that I am in the right place. Many students change their major a number of times before they graduate leaving them with extra years in school and thousands of dollars on extra classes. I, thankfully, haven’t had to do that. Figure out what you are good at and what you like to do and more importantly what is going to support you in the future and make a career out of it. Get out and try things that are interesting to you and just expose yourself to a variety of careers. I knew nothing about HTML or CSS when I started developing Staying-Social but I knew that I was interested in learning how and that one experience has spearheaded my future career in user experience.</p>
