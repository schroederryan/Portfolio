			<h1>Make a Difference</h1>
			<span>March 12th, 2017</span>
			<p>I’ve talked a lot about my time with Quicken and how excited I am to begin my full time career with them when I graduate in May. I haven’t, at least I don’t think, talked too much on the why behind this excitement and why I chose Quicken back in November without even entertaining any other offers. At that time, I don’t think I even knew the answer. I knew I loved the company and I loved the people I worked with which are great reasons in and of themselves to accept the job but I’ve recently figured out the core reason and I think it’s something a lot of fellow millennials can relate to.</p>
			<p>As I near graduation, I have had several recruiters from a slew of different companies reaching out to me offering me a job and completely ignoring the fact that my LinkedIn lists my position with Quicken Loans. I’m always respectful (thanks mom and dad) and they always insist on still asking me questions and “keeping in touch in case anything ever changes,” which just means contact us if you need a job. My point with this is that each one of them asked me the question, “What do you look for when applying to a company?” This is where the realization of why I love Quicken so much and what I will always look for in a job/company.</p>
			<p>I want to know that I can make a difference.</p>
			<p>For me, knowing that I am able to make an impact, no matter the scale, is extremely important in a job. I love the work I do, but what really excites me is being part of something much bigger than myself. I get excited and passionate about things that I know will directly benefit the company, my team, our clients, or anything else. That is the number one reason why I love Quicken as much as I do and why I continue talking about this company. Here I have the incredible opportunity to directly impact my fellow team members. The projects I have worked on have been used thousands and thousands of times by others within the company to help them answer questions, become more efficient, or to simply grow as a professional. That, to me, is powerful and is the main reason I wake up extremely excited to log in and get to work.</p>
			<p>This is also why I am really looking forward to moving to the city of Detroit. Detroit right now is going through a resurgence unparalleled by almost any other city in the country right now. After leaving the largest municipal bankruptcy in history in late 2014, Detroit has refocused its efforts on rebuilding what was once an economic powerhouse in the United States. There is still a long, long road ahead for the city as it struggles to expand the development seen in the urban core to the neighborhoods still riddled with crime, poor schooling and abandoned homes. I want to be a part of this. I want to get involved and lend a helping hand to areas that so desperately need one and truly help make a difference in this city.</p>
			<p>I recently watched an old video on Quicken Loans’ internship program and an intern at the time perfectly described the spirit of Detroit right now. Lisa Schlosberg, a New York native, said, “You can love New York more than anything but you’re still 1 of 8.5 million people in the city. In Detroit, you can love it and it feels like it matters… you can make a difference here.” That is exactly how I feel. I haven’t even made the official move yet but I already know of the organizations I plan to get involved in and the different events I want to attend. In addition to working in the heart of the urban core, I plan on living within the city of Detroit and will be spending some of my free time volunteering and helping the city continue to grow.</p>
			<p>I’ve been told numerous stories on jobs that only ask you to punch in, do the same work you did yesterday, punch out, and then go home. That to me sounds like hell and I definitely would add to the statistic of millennials that leave their job after a year or two. Thankfully, I have been fortunate enough to be a part of a company focused on making a difference and one that offers the opportunities to change the company for the better. In a generation that is more passionate about social issues, more connected and more curious than any other generation in the workforce right now, it’s important to find a company that aligns with your beliefs and allows you to make a positive impact. It truly makes coming into work much easier and before you know it, you’ll be there for 2 decades.</p>
