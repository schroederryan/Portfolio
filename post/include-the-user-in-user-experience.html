			<h1>Include the User in User Experience</h1>
			<span>March 6th, 2016</span>
			<p>When I wrote the article about my major, I explained a little bit about why user experience is so important. The user is ultimately what makes or breaks a business and that idea is something that needs to be addressed way before the product or business is even launched. One of the reasons I personally love Wikipedia, is it is so easy to use. They have all relevant information on one page broken up in easy to understand sections. You can search for a person and their age, relationship status, career as well as other information are right at the center because that is, most of the time, what users are going there to find out. If Wikipedia could be considered as a reliable source for research papers, let’s just say that it would be the only thing included in my bibliography.</p>
			<p>Simply knowing that the user’s experience needs to be considered when coming up with a new idea is not enough, though. What happens most of the time when coming up with and executing a new product or idea is that the creator has a certain vision for the product and that’s what they create. With that said, let’s create a short image. A man, we’ll call him Dan, creates a new type of medicine to help alleviate back pain. Dan has all the proper education and knows exactly what should go into the drug to make it work. Dan creates the drug and tests it on his wife, Amy, who has suffered from back pain since she was a little girl. It works flawlessly! After the test, they definitively decide that the product works and Dan rolls it out to the general population. I hope you can see what is wrong with this situation.</p>
			<p>While this may be an extreme example, and something that would (hopefully) never happen in the real world, it happens all the time when we are dealing with technology and the new products we roll out to the public. Simply testing the idea on the people that have envisioned it or built it is not enough. 5 people do not represent the whole population just like Amy didn’t represent all of the people that have back pain throughout the world. With this strategy, you have no idea how a real user will interact with your product and you could be out thousands or even millions of dollars.</p>
			<p>When you come up with an idea, it’s important to consider the actual user of the product. Get an early prototype of the product into the hands of a real user and just watch as they interact with it. This form of testing can be done in a variety of ways. Throughout my education we have used paper prototyping to get an early implementation into the hands of a user to see how they use it. We sketch up a few different screens of a potential app or website and put it in front of a user. We give them a task such as finding someones email and just watch as they navigate through the sketches. It’s a very low-fidelity test but it works. This allows you to flush out ideas of features and placement of those features early on.</p>
			<p>Now, this isn’t to say that user testing should be done at the beginning and that’s it. User testing should be done throughout the project at all stages. At each stage, you should be testing the product with a variety of real, intended users to see how they use the product. As many of us are probably aware, things always change throughout the process of a new idea or product. Decisions have to be made whether to include this feature or to use this material instead of another and most of these decisions are financial or time based. At no time, however, should a decision be made that adversely affects the users overall experience once the product comes to market.</p>
			<p>At my time with SNworks, I have unfortunately come across this issue many times. We, also, often get clients that don’t have a clue of the process of creating a new website. They know what they want on their website and how they want it to look and pay absolutely no attention to how their readers will interact with their new website. One of the biggest culprits is the navigation. Clients often have a very clear idea of how their navigation will be laid out even though it may make no sense to anyone. As a piece of advice, if you have to place a box on the section to explain what the articles in that section are about, it’s probably not a good section name.</p>
			<p>At the end, while technology moves at an alarming rate and businesses rush to create the next best thing, focusing on the user experience will get you a lot further. If you go to the app store and search “Planner” (as I recently did), you will be faced with hundreds if not thousands of results. If you go through the comments of any one of those apps, that should tell you all you need to know about user experience. If it’s bad, users will have no problem voicing their frustration and that only ends up hurting you. As a user, we can just download the next one in the list and move on with our day. As a business though, you don’t always have that luxury.</p>
