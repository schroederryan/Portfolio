			<h1>Life Update: Senior Year</h1>
			<span>October 17th, 2016</span>
			<p>It’s been awhile since I last wrote a blog post for my website and I have done a ton since that time. Five months ago I was finishing my junior year at Michigan State, figuring out where I was going to be working for the summer and trying to nail down my senior year course schedule. Now, I’m a senior with a pretty good idea of where I will be starting my career (I’m looking at you Quicken) and busier than I ever have been. </p>
			<p>Over the summer, as I have talked about several times, I interned for Quicken Loans and fell in love with the company. I was offered an extension to my internship in August and I continue to work for them from my home in East Lansing 3 days a week. Also, because I love the company so much, I make bi-weekly trips down to their offices in Detroit to attend team meetings and to stay connected to my team. I wake up at 5:15am, leave my house at 6:00am, get to the offices around 8:30am, leave around 4:30pm and don’t usually get home until 7:30pm. Yet with the long days, those are my favorite days of the month, by far. Every time I go down there, I realize yet again why I want to start my career with Quicken. I would be down there every day if I could, trust me.</p>
			<p>Aside from Quicken, I am still working at SNworks as a project manager. I got back there the 15th of August and was immediately given work to do. The first day back I had a meeting with my boss to talk about how he wanted me to completely design the interface for the newest version to our Content Management System - so ya know, a pretty small task. It felt good to get back into the swing of things there and I was welcomed back with open arms as you can tell with the task I was given. I gotta say though, having everyone excited that I was back made me truly realize how great of a job I have.</p>
			<p>Now that I have talked about my jobs, I guess I should talk about the main reason I am still at Michigan State: to get my degree. School is school - that’s about all I have to say. But in all reality, I am taking just two classes related to my major: one this fall and the other one in the spring. However, I have to get that magic number of 120 credits to graduate so my schedule is filled with other classes such as “Creativity and Entrepreneurship," “Web Design and Development” and two independent studies.</p>
			<p>One independent study is on the current state of Learning Management System’s (LMS). LMSs are what educational institutions use to house online content and are frequently used for online classes, grades or discussion areas. In many ways, they can be a great asset to education. However, the usability and, more importantly, the accessibility of almost every single LMS is atrocious. My goal for this independent study is to figure out why. Why do universities continue to pay what I’m assuming is a large amount of money for something that is so hard to use? I’ve used I think four different LMSs since starting school at MSU and they all are awful. Google has their own version of an LMS and it took me 2 weeks to figure out how to check my grades… Remember, my major is in user experience and website development so it’s not like i’m a novice internet user.</p>
			<p>That brings me to looking ahead for the semester. In December I will be giving another talk at the second annual Making Learning Accessible conference where I will discuss the preliminary findings of my research on LMSs. Last year I spoke for 15 minutes on how to create accessible forms and this year I will be talking for an hour on both LMSs and my other independent study which is to condense the accessibility guidelines into easy-to-read one-pagers. I had a blast last year and really learned a lot about presenting and am looking forward to presenting on more substantial material this year in front of what is sure to be an even bigger crowd than last year.</p>
			<p>I’m hoping to get back into the swing of writing more for my website but life gets in the way. I’m looking forward to my last year at Michigan State and hope to continue to accomplish the goals I have set for myself here. With that, of course, comes the social aspect and I think I am just now starting to come to grips with the fact that this is my last year and last opportunity to have all of my friends in one spot. I am more than ready for the next step in my life (Quicken??), but will definitely be sad to leave this place that I have called home for the last 3 years.</p>
