			<span class="label">Web Design/User Experience</span> | <span>April, 2017</span>
			<p>This was a project to display large amounts of data in an interactive website. Starting with a large data set of the 100 most populous cities in the United States, I went through a very iterative process to create an interactive website that allows users to sort through the data.</p>

			<span class="label">Web Design/User Experience</span> | <span>March, 2017</span>
			<p>The Fenner Nature Center is a local conservancy in Lansing that provides numerous educational exhibits for community members. With trails, community events and local wildlife, Fenner provides something for just about everyone. Though a huge benefit to the community, as a non-profit, operating almost entirely on donations from the community members, their website was a little outdated.</p>

			<span class="label">Accessibility/User Experience</span> | <span>December, 2016</span>
			<p>This project was started to explore the existing state of learning management systems used throughout higher education and how that pertains to accessibility. Additionally, this project was to explore the potential of a new learning management system that focuses more on the overall experience students and instructors desire when creating and hosting online content. Through research and design, I looked to create a better experience for online education while also ensuring all students had universal access to their course’s content.</p>

			<span class="label">Web Development</span> | <span>December, 2016</span>
			<p>I know it seems a little weird to include your portfolio website project on your actual portfolio website but I think there is value in its addition. Unlike most portfolio websites, I created mine from scratch designing and coding the entire thing. I firmly believe that with my major and my inevitable entrance into the technology industry when I graduate, I need to show that I can create a working website from start to finish.</p>

			<span class="label">Design</span> | <span>November, 2016</span>
			<p>SNworks had recently upgraded from out old, proprietary content management system, Gryphon 3, with the next version Gryphon 4. Realizing there was still a lot of room for us to improve our clients’ experience in creating student media, we wanted to build something completely different. We wanted to streamline the process that we have already perfected based completely on feedback we had received in the 3 years we had been open at the time. SNworks is in a unique position to solicit feedback from the clients we work directly with and that feedback is extremely beneficial when building a new product from the start.</p>

			<a href="/project/daily-targum"><img src="Images/thumb/rdt.png" alt="Daily Targum Redesign"></a>
			<span class="label">Project Management/Design</span> | <span>November, 2016</span>
			<p>As part of their contract with SNworks, each of our clients is eligible for a full, free redesign every 2 years. This was the case for Rutgers’ student media, <a href="http://www.dailytargum.com/" title="Daily Targum website">The Daily Targum</a> during the fall semester of 2016. I was the project manager for this project and was able to work with an incredible group of students in New Jersey to give their outdated website a much needed facelift. From beginning to end, the project went smoothly and both parties were extremely satisifed with the end result.</p>

			<a href="/project/condensing-wcag"><img src="Images/thumb/wcag.png" alt="Condensing WCAG"></a>
			<span class="label">Accessibility</span> | <span>September, 2016</span>
			<p>This project was a huge learning opportunity for me and I really want this to continue. Right now the W3C is meeting to discuss the next version of WCAG which would mean this resource would need to be updated. Additionally, this resource was really created with web developers in mind and I think other resources could be made available to better tailor other content creators.</p>

			<a href="/project/service-prototyping"><img src="Images/thumb/service.png" alt="Service Prototyping"></a>
			<span class="label">User Experience</span> | <span>April, 2016</span>
			<p>To practice prototyping things other than products, this assignment had us focus on a service within the Lansing area that could really use the help. I, along with my two group members, were given the Meals on Wheels organization and tasked with mapping out the service as it acts currently and figuring out where the issues were. Because this is an organization I was not apart of, the challenge was figuring out the components of the service without immersing myself in it.</p>

			<span class="label">User Experience</span> | <span>March, 2016</span>
			<p>As part of my prototyping class, I had to conceptualize and test a mobile app for the MSU People Finder. The current MSU People Finder site allows students to search for a fellow student or faculty member using their first name, last name and NetID (MSU&#8217;s identification system). The site served its intended purpose but I felt like more could be added to make it much more useful.</p>

			<span class="label">Project Management/Design</span> | <span>January, 2016</span>
			<p>University of Wisconsin - Madison&#8217;s student publication, The Daily Cardinal, came to us over the summer of 2015 to create a new website for them. The CMS (Content Management System) they were using was outdated and made their workflow unnecessarily hard. They also were looking for a new website as they transitioned from printing everyday to printing just twice a week. This was forcing them to put more focus on their digital content.</p>
