			<h1>About Me</h1>
			<img src="/Images/ryanschroeder.jpeg" alt="Ryan Schroeder">
			<p>Welcome to my portfolio site! My name is Ryan Schroeder and I’m a user experience specialist and designer while also doing a little front end web development. I’m interested in all things technology but more importantly, making technology usable for everyone.</p>
			<p>Before I get into what my professional interests are and what I’m currently doing, I would like to talk about how I got to where I am today and what better place to start than my hometown. I was born and raised in a small town in Northern Michigan called East Jordan. East Jordan has a year-round population of just 2,300 people and I graduated with a class of just 76 but I wouldn’t have wanted it any differently. I even prevented my parents from moving us until after I graduated (they moved to Saginaw, MI right after I graduated). Though it is a very small, tourist town, East Jordan is internationally known for one glamorous reason: manhole covers. East Jordan Iron Works (now know as just “EJ”) is headquartered in downtown East Jordan and supplies manhole covers all over the United States and in several countries across the world. Next time you walk across one, look down and I’ll bet it says either “East Jordan Iron Works”, “EJ”, or “East Jordan, MI.”</p>
			<p>After I graduated high school I moved on to my dream college Michigan State University. I toured a couple other universities mainly to skip school (though I was a good student, I promise) but my heart was always set on MSU. There I studied a brand new major at the time, Experience Architecture. I know the name doesn’t say a whole lot so I wrote a <a href="http://www.schroederryan.com/post/what-is-experience-architecture" title="What is Experience Architecture">blog post</a> describing what my major is and what we do.</p>
			<p>During my time at Michigan State I worked both as an accessibility specialist for the College of Arts and Letters as well as a project manager for SNworks. As an accessibility specialist, I worked with faculty throughout the college to ensure their content was accessible for students with disabilities. As a project manager, I managed a group of about 8 designers and developers to create and maintain brand new websites for student publications across the country. Some of our more notable schools include the University of Wisconsin - Madison, Duke University and Dartmouth College.</p>
			<p>The summer after my junior year of college I landed an internship with top mortgage lender Quicken Loans out of Detroit, Michigan. All summer I worked on an internal program used by thousands of our bankers and underwriters to make their jobs easier and more effective. As the summer was winding down, I was asked to stay on during my final year of school and work remotely. After working a few months from my house in East Lansing and commuting a couple times a month, I was offered a full time position on the same team I had been working with. I continue to work with that same team and work every day to improve their experience and make their jobs easier while also making our entire company more efficient.</p>
			<p>Aside from work related experience, I am extremely passionate about web design and overall user experience. Since starting my degree in user experience, I have looked at platforms differently and continue to think of ways they can be improved whether that be Facebook or a small website I visit once. Users remember a good experience and will continue to come back. Users also remember bad experiences and often love sharing their thoughts with friends or online message boards. It’s in everyone’s best interest to focus on the user of their platform and create the best possible experience. I do freelancing on the side and would love to talk about any possible ideas you may have for a website. Feel free to reach out to me at any time! <a href="/contact">Contact Information</a></p>
