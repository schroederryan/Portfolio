			<h2><a href="/post/see-ya-undergrad">See Ya Undergrad</a></h2>
			<span>May 1st, 2017</span>
			<p>I have to start this out by saying I honestly can’t believe I am already writing this. 4 years and 120 credit hours went by way too fast and I’m a little sad to see it go. Michigan State was my dream college and the only place I really saw myself attending.</p>

			<h2><a href="/post/make-a-difference">Make a Difference</a></h2>
			<span>March 12th, 2017</span>
			<p>I’ve talked a lot about my time with Quicken and how excited I am to begin my full time career with them when I graduate in May. I haven’t, at least I don’t think, talked too much on the why behind this excitement and why I chose Quicken back in November without even entertaining any other offers. At that time, I don’t think I even knew the answer.</p>

			<h2><a href="/post/my-issue-with-ads">My Issue With Ads</a></h2>
			<span>December 27th, 2016</span>
			<p>I would first like to say that I am an avid user of an ad blocker while I am on the internet. I apologize to anyone who relies on ad revenue as their income but they have become so intrusive that not having an ad blocker on severely diminishes my online experience. It has gotten to the point where many sites now completely sacrifice their user experience just to increase ad revenue. For what it’s worth, I thought I would weigh in.</p>

			<h2><a href="/post/life-update-senior-year">Life Update: Senior Year</a></h2>
			<span>October 17th, 2016</span>
			<p>It&rsquo;s been awhile since I last wrote a blog post for my website and I have done a ton since that time. Five months ago I was finishing my junior year at Michigan State, figuring out where I was going to be working for the summer and trying to nail down my senior year course schedule. Now, I&rsquo;m a senior with a pretty good idea of where I will be starting my career (I&rsquo;m looking at you Quicken) and busier than I ever have been. </p>

			<h2><a href="/post/detroit-from-an-outsider-turned-insider">Detroit: From an Outsider Turned Insider</a></h2>
			<span>June 23rd, 2016</span>
			<p>I&rsquo;m taking a break this time to write a more editorial type post. Instead of this being about my internship with Quicken Loans, I want to talk about the city my internship is in: Detroit. No matter who you are or where you&rsquo;re from, everyone seems to have their preconceived ideas of Detroit. I&rsquo;ve only been here for 7 weeks now but I wanted to give my take.</p>

			<h2><a href="/post/quicken-loans-week-six">Quicken Loans: Week 6</a></h2>
			<span>June 17th, 2016</span>
			<p>To start off, it was a terrible idea waiting this long to write another blog post about my internship at Quicken Loans. I wrote about my first week, which you can <a href="/post/quicken-loans-week-one">read about here</a>, but haven&rsquo;t written since. Since that time, though, so much has happened that I have no idea how I am going to include it all in a blog post that you&rsquo;re not reading until next year. In short, however, things are still going extremely well here and I absolutely love my team and this company even more than I did after week one.</p>

			<h2><a href="/post/quicken-loans-week-one">Quicken Loans: Week 1</a></h2>
			<span>May 13th, 2016</span>
			<p>Well, my first week is officially in the books and I think I learned more things in the first week here than I have in my first three years of college. I&rsquo;m obviously kidding but I have learned an incredible amount since starting on Monday. However, I have LOVED every second of it so far. Quicken Loans is a great company to work/intern for and that was apparent on my very first day.</p>

			<h2><a href="/post/junior-year-in-review">Junior Year In Review</a></h2>
			<span>April 29th, 2016</span>
			<p>I think the title kind of says it all but I&rsquo;m honestly in shock. It&rsquo;s hard to believe that I graduated high school three years ago and here I am starting to think about my last year at Michigan State University. From new site launches at SNworks to presentations at various conferences and even the countless heart attacks from watching the Spartans play, this year has been the best one yet and I am by no means ready to leave this great school.</p>

			<h2><a href="/post/why-i-wont-pay-for-unpaid-internships">Why I Won&rsquo;t Apply for Unpaid Internships</a></h2>
			<span>April 20th, 2016</span>
			<p>I am a soon to be senior in college (wait ... am I really a senior already??) who is all to familiar with the internship process. I have two incredible jobs that are related to my field of interest but that doesn&rsquo;t mean I don&rsquo;t want something else. Each company is different and each position will give me a different experience which is why I have looked at internships for this summer. I have applied to countless companies across the country and countless different jobs within my field. However, if I am reading through the description of the position and see the word “unpaid” I immediately close the tab and move on.</p>

			<h2><a href="/post/giving-great-presentations">Giving Great Presentations</a></h2>
			<span>April 10th, 2016</span>
			<p>The article this week is going to be very subjective and I&rsquo;ll start it out by saying that. Everyone is different and my advice on giving a great presentation might be completely useless to someone else. However, I have had the opportunity to give quite a few presentations not only for classes but at conferences as well. Throughout these opportunities I have been able to perfect my public speaking skills and have gotten really good and comfortable with giving presentations to a group of people.</p>

			<h2><a href="/post/moving-from-classroom-to-office-desk">Moving From Classroom to Office Desk</a></h2>
			<span>April 3rd, 2016</span>
			<p>I have held my current positions as a project manager and an accessibility specialist for a little over a year now and during that time I have learned a lot. Having these jobs has allowed me to directly apply everything that I am learning in my courses to my different positions. If I learn about a new project management methodology, I can go to my boss at The State News and talk with him about implementing it into our workflow. This ability, however, has taught me that everything I learn in my classes does not always transition nicely to the industry. This idea is what I wanted to discuss today. There is no perfect world.</p>
