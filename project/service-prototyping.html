			<h2>Assignment</h2>
			<p>To practice prototyping things other than products, this assignment had us focus on a service within the Lansing area that could really use the help. I, along with my two group members, were given the Meals on Wheels organization and tasked with mapping out the service as it acts currently and figuring out where the issues were. Because this is an organization I was not apart of, the challenge was figuring out the components of the service without immersing myself in it.</p>
			<p>Our first deliverable was a service ecology map that mapped out the service at a very broad level. We then moved to a service blueprint to connect the interactions and map out the different touchpoints used throughout the service. From these two deliverables, we were able to take a look at the service and identify key errors that could be improved upon. We noticed the lack of communication between the organization and the user in regards to the type of meals that were being served that day. We set out to create a simple, reusable pamphlet that would allow the user to see and even opt out of the meal being served that day.</p>
			<h2>Ecology Map</h2>
			<p>To create the ecology map we had to first figure out the different actors within the service. We knew we had the top level management, the volunteers and then the users. This allowed us to place the management actors in the "Enterprise" category, the volunteers in the "Agents" category and the users in the "Customers" category. After pinpointing the categories, we laid out everything each category would be concerned with within the service. This idea can be seen in the photo below.</p>

			<p>From this rough sketch, we were able to take examples from the internet to create a designed service ecology map. The finished map can be seen below. In the map, you essentially have the same thing as the rough sketch but with icons replacing a lot of the text. It clearly outlines the different phases of the service as well as the different touchpoints each category is concerned with.</p>

			<h2>Service Blueprint</h2>
			<p>Moving from the ecology map, we started outlining the user's journey through the service to identify errors within the organization. We mapped out the users journey from start to finish and then connected those interactions with different touchpoints within the organization as well as different roles throughout the service. We decided to have the user journey at the top of the blueprint with the line of visibility right below that. This means that everything that happens below that line is something that the user doesn't see. We thought this would be the easiest way to identify where communication is broken or where a method of completing an interaction could be improved upon. We also created a key to help us identify which type of person within the organization whether that was meal prep, meal delivery or management was concerned with each stage.</p>

			<h2>Prototype</h2>
			<p>We identified the lack of communciation coming from management to the user as the point we wanted to improve. We noticed that there was no touchpoint indicating what meal was being served that day. This resulted in many users refusing the food upon delivery and it then being wasted. We wanted to rectify that by creating a simple pamphlet that could be delivered each week outlining the next weeks meals. This would be coupled with a new "opt-out line" that would allow the user to call and decline a certain days meals. This would prevent the wasted trip by the volunteer and the wasted food. We wanted to keep this idea simple because of the demographic we were dealing with. The final pamphlet can be seen below.</p>

			<p>Additionally, because we were thinking of the future and the different platforms that are bound to be used in the near future, we mocked up a simple mobile application that would serve the same purpose. Though this was not our initial idea, it was a necessary path to follow. The mobile application would serve the same purpose but digitally instead of through a pamphlet. We created this application with the same idea in mind that we wanted it to be as simple as possible to limit the number of steps needed so users could easily adapt. The mobile screen designs can be seen below.</p>

			<h2>Take Aways</h2>
			<p>This project was a challenge undoubtedly. It was a challenge to map out a service I had had no experience with. This lack of experience led to a lot of assumptions by our group that are never a good thing when trying to come up with a solution. We were forced to create assumptions on certain things such as how volunteers interact with the route sheet and how the communication between management and user could be improved. If done again, I would like the opportunity to shadow the service for a set amount of time. I think it is vital in a project like this to be able to immerse yourself in the service before you begin mapping out the characters and touchpoints.</p>
			<p>Overall, I think this project went very well. Though we had to create assumptions on a lot of different aspects of the service, my group looked at every different problem that we saw and worked to come up with solutions. We thought of solutions for each problem and weighed them to see which solutions were known to work and which ones would need to be prototyped. This led us to look past the analog route sheets as we knew that digitizing them would work and there was no point in prototyping something we know is going to work. The pamphlet offered a great, practical solution to a big problem within the service and it was an enjoyable process getting to that point.</p>
