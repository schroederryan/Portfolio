			<h2>Project</h2>
			<p>One of my classes for my senior year was to condense the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/" target="_blank">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines or WCAG 2.0</a>. Let me first describe what WCAG is and why it’s important before I go into what the project was and why I, myself, pursued this.</p>
			<p>There is a community called the <a href="https://www.w3.org/" target="_blank">World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)</a> made up of a full-time staff as well as members of the public from across the world that work to create standards for the World Wide Web. Some examples are the semantics that developers use when creating websites (i.e. &lt;video&gt; or &lt;strong&gt; tags). Another example is ensuring all browsers meet the universal standards set by the W3C. Before, you had to write entirely different code based on the browser a person would be using and thankfully, it’s gotten a lot better.</p>
			<p>With that said, to further ensure equal access to the web whether that be browser, device, etc. the W3C created the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines. These guidelines are specifically aimed at creating an accessible web - a web that everyone, regardless of disability, can use and access. These guidelines are something everyone should know and implement when they are creating websites and/or products - and I mean everyone. WCAG isn’t just for those with a hearing impairment or who use their computer solely with a keyboard, it can be applicable to everyone. For example, one of the guidelines in WCAG is having a clearly defined, hierarchical structure to your website with proper use of the heading tags. This helps not only screen reader users in determining the layout of your website, but it also helps sighted users break up content in an easier way. If you have a bunch of text on a page, a user isn’t going to be able to digest all of the content in one glance and pick out the pieces that are relevant to them and might leave your site. See the importance now? That’s just one example of many.</p>
			<p>That leaves me with the final piece: why me? Accessibility isn’t something I have touched on a lot on my website, but it’s actually been a huge part of my professional life for almost 2 years now. I worked as an accessibility and usability consultant for the <a href="http://www.cal.msu.edu/" target="_blank">College of Arts and Letters</a> here at Michigan State with the goal of ensuring all content within the college was accessible according to these WCAG guidelines. My first task when diving into the world of accessibility was to literally read WCAG, word for word. Now I don’t think that was a bad approach but it was overwhelming to say the least and is partially the reason for this project. Everyone should at least be able to understand what they should be implementing and designing when creating products for the web. I have worked with numerous faculty members throughout the college, given presentations at conferences and to small groups on accessibility, and continue to ensure all content is created with every user in mind. I’ve read these guidelines many times and I’m sure I’ll read them many more as I work to summarize them into more digestible content.</p>
			<h2>Process</h2>
			<p>Each week I would go through and almost review the next criterion in WCAG 2.0. It was important to me to read through what the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) had to say on the criterion to make sure I was condensing accurately. From there, I would fill out the template with the definition, what that definition meant, why it is was important and an example. I truly believe, however, that the success of this project came from having someone else read through my condensed version to make sure it made sense still. Once all criterion were condensed, I created a booklet to house all of the one-pagers in one place.</p>
			<h2>Reflection</h2>
			<p>This project taught me a ton about accessibility. I had read through WCAG 2.0 before and I still was able to make better sense of the why behind each criterion and how to apply that to a relevant example. I have a little bit of web developing experience and I think that aspect help think of different, but still common, examples for each criterion. The W3C has done a much better job of condensing the guidelines make sense but being able to relate that to real-world examples as well as illustrating the why behind each one was the big success.</p>
			<p>The one thing I think I would do different if I were to do this project again would be to get it in front of more people and do more research behind the use. After going through it myself and talking with people after my presentation on this project, I would have loved to see the reaction to those that would actually use this as a resource. Was their content more accessible after having a resource such as this or did it remain the same? Did the examples and content within the booklet make sense? These are the types of questions I would have loved to have time for. I think added research into the booklet and the condensed versions would be valuable for not only myself but the project as a whole.</p>
			<h2>Next Steps</h2>
			<p>As of right now, I would like for this to be a resource for those trying to understand and create accessible content. After speaking with several faculty members at the Making Learning Accessible conference regarding this project, many expressed interest in having this resource available to them in some matter. Currently, they are all housed individually on my website and in two copies in the booklet form. I will be adding the full PDF file to my website but it would be great if the College of Arts and Letters could provide this as a resource or other colleges were able to have more universal access.</p>
			<p>This project was a huge learning opportunity for me and I really want this to continue. Right now the W3C is meeting to discuss the next version of WCAG which would mean this resource would need to be updated. Additionally, this resource was really created with web developers in mind and I think other resources could be made available to better tailor other content creators.</p>
