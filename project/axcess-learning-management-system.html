			<h1>Axcess: An Accessible Learning Mangement System</h1>
			<span>December, 2016</span>
			<h2>Background</h2>
			<p>This project was started to explore the existing state of learning management systems used throughout higher education and how that pertains to accessibility. Additionally, this project was to explore the potential of a new learning management system that focuses more on the overall experience students and instructors desire when creating and hosting online content. Through research and design, I looked to create a better experience for online education while also ensuring all students had universal access to their course’s content.</p>
			<h2>Process</h2>
			<p>The beginning steps of this project were to nail down the scope. Tackling a challenge such as learning management systems is daunting and needed to be digested before starting to think about a brand new platform. With that said, the initial process, for me, was to learn as much as I could about learning management systems and why they were used in the beginning. Learning everything there is to know about the subject you are looking to recreate is critical in your success and this project was no different. This research came in the form of published articles/books, surveys to both students and faculty members, focus groups and informal discussions with colleagues.</p>
			<p>From the research, I moved into a sort of middle “analysis” phase where I could take the time to make sense of all the data I had accumulated. Because of the amount of research I had done, it was critical for me to take out the information that I thought was going to be helpful to this project and synthesize it in a way that I could use later on. After taking in all of the data, I was able to accurately inform my decisions for the next phase which was designing what a new learning management system could and should look like. Due to the timeframe being the end of the semester, this was the point at which I felt I could reasonably accomplish and be pleased with.</p>
			<h2>Findings</h2>
			<p>From the research I conducted throughout the project thus far, several big findings came to light. The first thing I will discuss is the level of customization that is currently lacking and that is desired by both students and faculty. It is no secret that every student learns differently. Even though this is almost universally known, it is not shown in the current learning management systems universities are paying for. Instructors are often forced into utilizing features the way learning management systems think they should and they have no luxury in turning on/off certain features. The same can be said for students. Features are displayed whether used or not with little ability to expand. For example, calendars are a big tool for learning management systems but are often not used by the instructor or the student prefers to use another method such as the calendar on their computer or a planner. If you’re not using the feature, why is it still there to clutter up your content?</p>
			<p>Another major finding was the lack of training both for students and instructors. In a national survey conducted by Educause, 51% of students felt they would be more effective if they were trained on how to use the learning management system before they got to college. Yes, I do agree with that but I think the underlying finding here is that learning management systems are not intuitive to use. While I do think there is added value in giving a demo on the learning management system before the students are forced to use it, it should also be intuitive enough for students to be able to learn, especially when these are the same students who were able to navigate their way around an iPad when they were 5.</p>
			<p>Continuing on, one big ask from instructors is more analytical data on their students and their course. Analytics are a huge resource for almost every company as a way to measure engagement, return on investment, traffic and a ton of other things. This ability is a huge missed opportunity with current learning management systems. Technology currently in use allows us to track how long in a video students clicked out, or how long it took them to get to the bottom of an article, or even how many times they changed their answer before submitting their quiz. I found that this information is extremely valuable to instructors and they would love for that technology to be built right into the learning management system.</p>
			<p>The last finding I will talk about is the lack of accessibility throughout current learning management systems. The struggle with this is that students, disability or not, should be able to access the content. More often than not, they can’t and special accommodations have to be made on a case by case basis. Some big culprits are the lack of keyboard functionality, the lack of defined structure, inconsistent page formats and media not transmitted in different ways. While much of this falls on the instructor’s shoulders, there is a lot that I found can be done to help this process and better ensure all students have the same level of access to the content in the course.</p>
			<h2>Designs</h2>
			<p>As mentioned, I wanted to take the research that I did over the course of this project and imagine what a learning management system that addressed the findings above would look like. I wanted this new platform to be simple, user friendly, interactive and most importantly, fully accessible. I have included several screenshots of the direction I have taken to showcase the consistent structure and the accessible features such as the “View Transcript” button on the content pages when videos are embedded.</p>

			<h2>Reflection</h2>
			<p>No project would ever be without its setbacks and I think the biggest setback for this project was simply time. Because this was structured as an independent study with a firm deadline set for the end of the semester, it was tough to be able to dedicate a ton of extra time to any single phase. I would have liked to conduct more in-depth usability studies and detail a lot more of the complex user scenarios for all different types of students. Additionally, I would have liked to do more usability studies on the mockups that I created. Ideally, I would have had a full, interactive prototype to take students through and capture their experiences of the platform I am proposing. More research and more testing with users who will ultimately be using the platform is never a bad thing.</p>
			<p>Overall, this project, I think, went really well. Taking on researching and then designing a new learning management system was a huge task but it was extremely rewarding. I have a lot of experience with learning management systems as a senior at Michigan State University so I also had a personal interest in the project. Seeing the reaction from fellow students and instructors fueled that personal interest even more.</p>
			<h2>Future</h2>
			<p>Though I won’t be getting any course credit for this type of work in the future, I would still like to pursue this project on the side. My vision for the immediate future is to continue iterating the designs I have already started while also continuing with supplemental research to further inform my decisions. I simply think there is too much potential with this project to put it on the back burner at this time. My goal is to continue with the designs and have it in a great place to start development when that time comes. In addition to the huge potential I see for this project, I am extremely passionate about this type of work and would love for this to turn into a career in some regard. </p>
