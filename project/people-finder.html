			<h1>MSU People Finder</h1>
			<span>March, 2016</span>
			<p>As part of my prototyping class, I had to conceptualize and test a mobile app for the MSU People Finder. The current MSU People Finder site allows students to search for a fellow student or faculty member using their first name, last name and NetID (MSU's identification system). The site served its intended purpose but I felt like more could be added to make it much more useful.</p>
			<h2>User Scenario</h2>
			<p>To ensure I was fitting the needs of the intended users for this apps I created a fairly basic user scenario to test against. My user was:</p>
			<blockquote>Derrick, a computer science junior, needs to get help on his big project for the semester that is due in just a few days. He’s been working on his project for hours in his own bedroom and needs to get help from the TA, the only one in the class that holds weekly office hours. The problem is he doesn’t remember the TA’s name and it isn’t mentioned on the syllabus anywhere. Frustrated by the lack of help from his classmates who also don’t know anything about the TA, he looks somewhere else. Knowing just the class he is in, he turns to the people search app to try and find either the TA’s office hours, office location or even just his email to try and get in touch and get some help.</blockquote>
			<h2>Sketching</h2>
			<p>My first iteration of the application was a rough sketch that we could then test with others within the class. My initial thought for the application was to be able to search by department if you didn't know the names as well as seeing who was in your class. Based on needs of my own, it would be helpful to have a list of everyone that is in the class for reasons such as getting notes for a missed day of class or emails of those within your group.</p>
			<p>I sketched our ideas on note cards that would resemble phone screens so I could use others within the class to test our idea. I was able to show our idea to several other classmates and explain the process to make sure it not only made sense but that there weren't elements of the idea that were overlooked or forgot about entirely.</p>

			<p>After I created the sketches, I then tested the app on users outside of the class. Using my user scenario as a guide, I put the app in front of several different students and had them interact with it. I would ask my user questions such as "You're trying to find another students email address and you know that he's in the class" and record them as they try and find the information. This information allowed us to pinpoint areas of complexity for users and adjust our designs to make it easier to use.</p>
			<p>The final deliverable for this project was a digital prototype in any application we wanted. I chose to experiment with Adobe's new "Experience Design" to design my application and do one final round of testing. The final design proved to be much more useful than the first few iterations.</p>

			<h2>Take Aways</h2>
			<p>There were a couple things, while going through this process, that I definitely learned and will use the next time I go through this process. One thing was the amount of desinging I had to do to create a workable user test. I started the process creating the bare minimum for screens and that proved to be too confusing for my users. I ended up creating about 12 different screens to ensure the user could navigate the app.</p>
			<p>Another thing that came out of this project was the value in lower fidelity prototypes. Before this, I was used to sketching out my ideas very briefly on paper and then going right to a digital program to mock it up. However, I found that there is great value in not overdesigning too early and letting your user tests guide you in the design.</p>
