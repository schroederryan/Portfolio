			<h1>Portfolio Website</h1>
			<span>December, 2016</span>
			<h2>Project</h2>
			<p>I know it seems a little weird to include your portfolio website project on your actual portfolio website but I think there is value in its addition. Unlike most portfolio websites, I created mine from scratch designing and coding the entire thing. I firmly believe that with my major and my inevitable entrance into the technology industry when I graduate, I need to show that I can create a working website from start to finish. This portfolio website also serves as a great place to showcase my other projects and my blog posts.</p>
			<h2>Process</h2>
			<p>I tried to go about this portfolio website just like I would any other professional project. I started out sketching my ideas and moving to more full-fledged designs in my go-to design program, Sketch. It was important to me to make sure that I was getting the most out of my website so I started designing with the content in mind. As with most portfolio websites, you have a place for your work, you have your optional blog and then you have an about me/contact page. These were all the basic things I wanted to include on my website but wanted them to be simple and easily manageable.</p>

			<p>Developing the website took the most time as it required a lot of supplemental research on my end. I had taken a few web authoring courses before creating this website but none that included everything I was trying to include in my portfolio. I also had the added challenge of ensuring my website was full accessible according to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) created by the World Wide Consortium (W3C). I have done a lot of accessibility work in my career thus far and have directed people to my website from conferences explicitly on accessibility.</p>

			<h2>Takeaways</h2>
			<p>I don’t develop websites very often, though my role at Quicken Loans allows me to create more web content through coding for internal team members. I enjoyed the challenge of creating my portfolio website and then creating the content for it. I hope to continually update it and redesign it with new standards and trends in the years to come. I can never really sit on one design for too long before I want to change it completely and learn something new. That constant change, however, is half the fun for me.</p>
