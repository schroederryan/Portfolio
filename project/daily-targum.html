			<h1>Daily Targum Redesign</h1>
			<span>November, 2016</span>
			<h2>The Client</h2>
			<p>As part of their contract with SNworks, each of our clients is eligible for a full, free redesign every 2 years. This was the case for Rutgers’ student media, <a href="http://www.dailytargum.com/" title="Daily Targum website">The Daily Targum</a> during the fall semester of 2016. I was the project manager for this project and was able to work with an incredible group of students in New Jersey to give their outdated website a much needed facelift.</p>
			<h2>The Process</h2>
			<p>Rutgers’ redesign process started as most of our other sites do: a kickoff call with all of those involved. During this kickoff call, I got to hear what they liked about their existing website, what they were hoping to change with the redesign and any other issues they wanted to address before we started this project. Because I was also doing the designs for this project, I focused more on the design of their new site and look to other websites, both clients of ours and professional sites, for inspiration. They ended up really liking the ever-popular card layout that stems from Google’s Material Design.</p>
			<p>From the kickoff call, I created the designs for all of the main pages and was able to get them approved by the students relatively quickly. For the most part, this website was fairly standard with the big feature being the sliding navigation that comes from the side of the screen. We moved from designs to development fairly quickly and remained on schedule for a Thanksgiving launch.</p>

			<h2>Takeaways</h2>
			<p>This was one of my better projects during my time at SNworks. The students at Rutgers were incredible helpful and receptive to all of my ideas. With my background in user experience, I could steer them in directions to improve the overall experience for their readers. At the end of the day, that was their main goal. Additionally, we were able to stick to our schedule the entire time even when we had multiple personnel changes on our team. From start to finish, this project went smoothly and both parties were extremely satisfied with the end result.</p>
