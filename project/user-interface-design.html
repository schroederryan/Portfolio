			<h1>User Interface Design</h1>
			<span>November, 2016</span>
			<h2>Background</h2>
			<p>SNworks had recently upgraded from out old, proprietary content management system, Gryphon 3, with the next version Gryphon 4. Realizing there was still a lot of room for us to improve our clientsâ€™ experience in creating student media, we wanted to build something completely different. We wanted to streamline the process that we have already perfected based completely on feedback we had received in the 3 years we had been open at the time. SNworks is in a unique position to solicit feedback from the clients we work directly with and that feedback is extremely beneficial when building a new product from the start.</a></p>
			<h2>Process</h2>
			<p>When I returned from my summer internship in the middle of August, I was immediately given the task of creating the interface for our new platform CEO (Collaborate, Edit, Organize). I was briefed on the status of the project, given instructions on design elements and told to get to work. I created the icons, created the base design and everything after that. Every iteration of my design was brought in with stakeholders to discuss and flush out before moving on. Because this was such a large project, this process was necessary to ensure the overall user experience was what we at SNworks wanted it to be and what our clients have been asking for.</p>
			<h2>Mockups</h2>
			<p>I created 38 different screens for CEO in Sketch to fully showcase the entire experience. It was important to not only me but to the stakeholders I was designing for that this experience was as complete as we could get it. A complete design, in this situation, allowed our dedicated software developer uninterrupted time to create the platform instead of continually asking questions. Below are a few of the screens I designed.</p>

			<h2>Takeaways</h2>
			<p>This was one of the biggest projects I have been a part of but extremely rewarding. The entire design took me a couple months to complete and finalize especially with all of the iterations that were involved. In the end, with the collaborative efforts of all involved, we were able to create something that will benefit our clients for years to come and hopefully streamline their process. We hope CEO is a driving force in attaining new clients to our ever growing portfolio and I will always be able to say I helped create our leading platform.</p>
