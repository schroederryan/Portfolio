			<h1>Fenner Nature Center Website</h1>
			<span>March, 2017</span>
			<p>The Fenner Nature Center is a local conservancy in Lansing that provides numerous educational exhibits for community members. With trails, community events and local wildlife, Fenner provides something for just about everyone. Though a huge benefit to the community, as a non-profit, operating almost entirely on donations from the community members, their website was a little outdated.</p>
			<h2>Process</h2>
			<p>Designing a new website for Fenner was a multi-step process both individually and with group members. A Landscape analysis was done to compare Fenner's website to other, similar websites. In groups, we also created content and audience maps as well as detailed user scenarios to ensure nothing was left out. This part of the process was crucial in understand the user of their current website and what users are using their website for.</p>
			<p>From there, I sketched out possible ideas for their new websites with each iteration gaining both content and visuals to make the website more appealing than it currently is. A style guide was also created to ensure consistency throughout the new design. While Fenner currently has a detailed style guide, I was able to add some color to the existing shades of brown and gray and create consistency with their typography.</p>
			<p>After creating the style guide and the initial wireframes, I moved on to several different versions of their website. A crucial skill in designing a website for a client is the ability to adapt and iterate throughout the process and that is the case when moving to the visual design compositions. My designs changed quite drastically to veer away from conventional web design standards. I was challenged with displaying information in a way that isn’t plain text with images in boxes. My final design compositions reflect this change in thinking.</p>
			<h2>Landscape Analysis</h2>
			<p>A landscape analysis was completed to compare the existing Fenner Nature Center with similar websites. I chose Potter Park Zoo as a comparative website and detailed both websites’ strengths and weaknesses. Potter Park Zoo was chosen due to its location in Lansing as well as its similar exhibits and offerings.</p>
			<h4>Fenner Nature Center:</h4>
			<p>Strengths:
				<ul>
					<li>‘Donate’ button in the footer provides a consistent call to action for the nature center.</li>
					<li>Contact information, while at the bottom, provides a consistent resource to stay in touch with the center.</li>
					<li>Drop down menus allow for quick access to subordinate pages.</li>
					<li>The ‘Fenner Staff’ page adds a personal touch to the center by providing background on their employees.</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p>Weaknesses:
				<ul>
					<li>The amount of navigation links and subordinate menus can make the information overwhelming.</li>
					<li>The color contrast can make the information hard to read for some users.</li>
					<li>Important information is often buried within the page preventing a quick scan for desired content.</li>
					<li>For a nature center, there are relatively few photos throughout the site.</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<h4>Potter Park Zoo:</h4>
			<p>Strengths:
				<ul>
					<li>Breadcrumbs offer an easy way to retrace your steps while navigating through the website.</li>
					<li>Highly detailed images of the animals and Zoo itself break up the content nicely and increase the likelihood of a visit.</li>
					<li>Interactive buttons throughout the website create a multitude of call to actions on each page.</li>
					<li>The ‘Donate’ page offers quick clicks to common donation amounts.</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p>Weaknesses:
				<ul>
					<li>The lack of dropdown menus force a user to click into a high-level page and then into a subordinate page.</li>
					<li>The landing page, due to the social media posts, has a lot of unnecessary white space.</li>
					<li>The “About the Zoo” page doesn’t offer an extensive background on the zoo and what it does.</li>
					<li>Information architecture can be confusing.</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<h2>Content Map</h2>
			<p>In groups, we created a content map that categorized all content on their current website. Fenner, as an existing website, has content grouped in ways that not all users would understand. Our challenge for this part of the project was to reimagine the content and it could better be grouped for their users. We created both an analog and a digital version as seen below.</p>

			<img src="/Images/ContentMap2.png" alt="Digital Content Map">
			<h2>Audience Map</h2>
			<p>Similar to the content map, the audience map was created to account for all types of visitors Fenner may attract. Each type of user requires different content on the website and this exercise forced us to account for each one. Like the content map, we also created an analog and digital version of this map.</p>

			<img src="/Images/AudienceMap2.png" alt="Digital Audience Map">
			<h2>Lynch Map/User Paths</h2>
			<p>Taking both the content and audience maps, we digitized the information into a Lynch Map placing all content into categories. Additionally, we each created a user scenario and detailed that scenario on the Lynch Map.</p>
			<h4>Lynch Map</h4>

			<h4>User Scenario</h4>
			<p>Jenny is a 38-year-old mother of a 6-year-old boy in the Lansing area. Through her child’s school, she learned about the Fenner Nature Center and thought it would be a great idea for her child’s upcoming birthday. Though the party is 3 months away, she goes online to the Fenner website to see if hosting a birthday is an option. Ideally, the party would be both entertaining and informative for the 15 children she plans on inviting. After visiting the site, she believes the Fenner Nature center would be the perfect place for her child’s 7th birthday party.</p>
			<h4>Lynch Map with User Path</h4>

			<h2>Sketching</h2>
			<p>With all content accounted for and a detailed user scenario to design for, I quickly sketched wireframes for each page of the user scenario. Sketches help to quickly iterate through design ideas at a very early stage.</p>

			<img src="/Images/Sketch4.png" alt="Sketch of the Birthday Parties page">
			<h2>Low-Content Wireframes</h2>
			<p>Moving from the rough sketches, I moved to creating digital low-content wireframes to better illustrate how the content would fit on each page. This practice also helps illustrate how the user in the user scenario reaches the content they are looking for.</p>

			<img src="/Images/LowConWireframe3.png" alt="rivate Events page wireframe">
			<img src="/Images/LowConWireframe4.png" alt="SBirthday Parties page wireframe">
			<h2>High-Content Wireframes</h2>
			<p>Taking wireframes one step further, high-content wireframes add in photos and other elements to start to bring to life the end website. High-content wireframes still lack the stylistic elements.</p>

			<img src="/Images/HighConWireframe3.png" alt="Homepage wireframe">
			<img src="/Images/HighConWireframe4.png" alt="Homepage wireframe">
			<h2>Style Guide</h2>
			<p>The Fenner Nature Center had an existing branding guide but I added several color swatches as well as developed a consistent style for the text throughout the website.</p>
			<img src="/Images/StyleGuide.png" alt="Style Guide">
			<h2>Visual Design Compositions</h2>
			<p>Visual Design Compositions are the final step in the website design process. These documents include all stylistic elements cemented in the style guide as well as all content. As mentioned, these final designs differ quite significantly from the wireframes and that was intentional. Wireframes are meant to be a framework for the designs but are in no way the final versions. In many situations, designs change dramatically as clients are able to visually see the entire website. I was challenged with designing this website in a way that didn't quite fit in the general mold of web design.</p>
