			<hr>
			<p>This idea started as an independent study during my senior year at Michigan State University. Throughout my four years, I had used countless learning management systems and all seemed to be missing something. The user experience was poor and the universal accessibility was non-existent. This astonished me as thousands of higher education institutions were using systems that were hard to use and inaccessible to students with a variety of disabilities or learning impairments.</p>
			<p>Axcess looks to challenge these current offerings of learning management systems currently in place by thousands of educational institutions throughout the country. By focusing on student engagement and ensuring the technology is accessible to all, Axcess will hopefully soon become the standard for how educational content should be delivered digitally.</p>
			<p>Currently, learning management systems fail to adhere to student and faculty needs. Many platforms lack features such as metrics on student engagement or muddy their features in cluttered navigations that are hard to use by most students. Axcess fixes this issue by incorporating user insight from the beginning.</p>
			<p>This website will be constantly updated to allow prospective users the chance to provide their feedback on the most up-to-date version of the design or production available. Removing the secrecy so often found in development allows Axcess to be a system for all. Be sure to come back often for all of the updates.</p>

			<p>I will continue to update this section with the latest designs and the latest features for you to give input on. I will continue to share what I am working on and where I am with the project to provide the transparency I think is important.</p>
			<p>As of right now, I have linked out to the full all of the designs I have worked on thus far. Here you can find the <a href="/AxcessLMS/Images/PDFs/designs.pdf" target="_blank">full PDF file of all the designs.</a> I have designed the student side as this is what I presented on at the Accessible Learning Conference. Because I am a student, I focused my preliminary efforts on the student side while also taking into account how a faculty memeber would need to use the learning management system.</p>

			<p>Unfortunately, this is a side project at the moment with hopes to continue work as much as I can. With that said, I would love as much input as possible. As I mentioned in the background of this project, I want this to include as much insight from students and faculty as possible. Because of my degree and interest in user experience, I look to include as much user insight as I can get. Products and software succeed when they are built for their users and with their users in mind. Products and software fail when they force ideas and features on to their users and that's my assumption of a lot of learning management systems on the market right now. Axcess will not be that.</p>
			<p>If you would like to reach out to me regarding any input or feedback on this project, please feel free to email me at <a href="mailto:schroeder2013@gmail.com?Subject=Axcess%20Feedback">schroeder2013@gmail.com.</a> Your input is greatly appreciated and will only further ensure Axcess is the best learning management system.</p>
